              results might be influenced substantially by the imaging modality
              and timing of assessment. We tested the hypothesis that brain
              regions found to be associated with acute language deficits
              depend on (1) timing of behavioral measurement, (2) imaging
              sequences utilized to define the ``lesion'' (structural
              abnormality only or structural plus perfusion abnormality), and
              (3) power of the study. We studied 191 individuals with acute
              left hemisphere stroke with MRI and language testing to identify
              areas critical for spoken word comprehension. We use the data
              from this study to examine the potential impact of these three
              variables on lesion-symptom mapping. We found that only the
              combination of structural and perfusion imaging within 48 h of
              onset identified areas where more abnormal voxels was associated
              with more severe acute deficits, after controlling for lesion
              volume and multiple comparisons. The critical area identified
              with this methodology was the left posterior superior temporal
              gyrus, consistent with other methods that have identified an
              important role of this area in spoken word comprehension. Results
              have implications for interpretation of other lesion-symptom
              mapping studies, as well as for understanding areas critical for
              auditory word comprehension in the healthy brain. We propose that
              lesion-symptom mapping at the acute stage of stroke addresses a
              different sort of question about brain-behavior relationships
              than lesion-symptom mapping at the chronic stage, but that timing
              of behavioral measurement and imaging modalities should be
              considered in either case. Hum Brain Mapp 38:2990-3000, 2017.

              disability and outcome. Using the original Framingham Study

              disability differences in stroke survivors at six months
              post-stroke. Logistic regression analyses were performed to
              estimate odds ratios, comparing men and women, and adjusting for
              age, and age and stroke subtype. Age and gender-matched controls
              were then compared to distinguish stroke-related disability from
              disability associated with general aging. Results showed that
              almost half (43\%) of all elderly stroke survivors in the cohort
              had moderate to severe neurological deficits. In the crude
              analyses, women were more dependent in ADLs (33.9\% vs 15.6\%),
              less likely to walk unassisted (40.3\% vs 17.8\%), and living in

              stroke cases were significantly more disabled in all domains
              studied. In this elderly cohort, more women experienced initial
              strokes and were more disabled at 6 months post-stroke than men.
              However, older age at stroke onset, not gender or stroke subtype,

              A critical review",
  author   = "Kapur, N",
  abstract = "The aim in this review article is to document research findings
              that have shown paradoxical effects of nervous system changes,
              whereby direct or indirect neural damage may result in
              facilitation of behavioural functions. Such findings have often
              been ignored or undervalued in the brain-behaviour research
              literature. A further aim is to consider possible mechanisms and
              theoretical insights related to this facilitation. Analyses of
              relevant studies show that two major types of paradoxical
              functional facilitation (PFF) effects may be distinguished. (i)
              Situations where damage to intact brain tissue brings to normal
              or near normal a previously subnormal or abnormal level of
              functioning. I refer to improved levels of functioning in such
              contexts as restorative PFF effects. One of the best documented
              examples of such PFF effects is the 'Sprague effect', whereby
              collicular lesions may bring about an improvement in visual
              functioning following an initial occipital lesion. (ii)
              Situations where a subject with nervous system pathology or
              sensory loss performs better than normal control subjects on a
              particular task. I refer to improved levels of performance in
              these contexts as enhancing PFF effects. Restorative and
              enhancing PFF effects have been found in a range of domains,
              including memory, sensory and perceptual functions, and language
              functioning. A potential contribution of PFF effects is that they
              highlight two important neural mechanisms, i.e. inhibition and
              compensatory plasticity. Two broad classes of theoretical
              insights related to PFF effects are therefore discussed: (i)
              inhibitory mechanisms, which form part of an interactive view of
              brain function where competitive opponent-processing is a
              significant feature; (ii) 'compensatory augmentation', which
              occurs as a specific manifestation of CNS plasticity. Both of
              these mechanisms are considered in relation to paradoxical
              increases in CBF and anatomical annexation effects that are seen
              in neurological patients and in subjects with sensory loss.
              Paradoxical functional facilitation paradigms represent a
              powerful methodological tool for confirming or refuting
              hypotheses in brain-behaviour research. The counter-intuitive
              nature of PFF findings provides a particularly persuasive set of
              evidence in support of neural, conceptual or computational models
              of brain function that specifically predict paradoxical
              facilitation of cognitive functioning.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many therapies are emerging that aim to
              improve motor function in people with stroke. Identifying key
              biological substrates needed for treatment gains would help to
              predict treatment effects and to maximize treatment impact. The
              current study addressed the hypothesis that behavioral gains from
              therapy targeting distal upper extremity are predicted by the
              structural integrity of key motor system white matter tracts.
              METHODS: Twenty-three subjects with chronic left-sided stroke
              underwent robotic therapy targeting the distal right upper
              extremity. MRI was obtained at baseline and used to outline the
              infarct. For each subject, the degree to which stroke injured
              each of 4 descending white matter tracts (from the primary motor
              cortex, supplementary motor area, dorsal premotor cortex, and
              ventral premotor cortex, respectively) was determined.
              Correlations between tract-specific injury and behavioral gains
              from therapy were then examined. RESULTS: Numerous examples were
              found whereby tract-specific injury predicted treatment gains.
              The strongest correlations pertained to stroke injury to tracts
              descending from the primary motor cortex and dorsal premotor
              cortex. Infarct volume and baseline behavior were weak predictors
              of treatment gains. CONCLUSIONS: Extent of injury to specific
              motor tracts predicts behavioral gains from treatment in subjects
              with chronic stroke. This supports a role for these tracts in
              mediating treatment effects and reinforces the importance of
              lesion location in stroke. Tract-specific injury was stronger
              than infarct volume or baseline clinical status at predicting
              gains, identifies subjects with sufficient biological substrate
              to improve from therapy, and so might be useful as an entry
              criterion in repair-based trials.",

              corticospinal neuron populations projecting to different zones in
              the cervical and more caudal spinal segments in the macaque that
              are labeled with retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers;
              2-4 differentiable dyes were injected into different sites in the
              cervical spinal cord of each of 11 monkeys. Lamina V of the
              cerebral cortex, in which all corticospinal neuron somas were
              located, was unfolded with computer assistance to form a flat
              surface, and local soma densities were displayed on this plane as
              contour and 3-D maps. At least nine discrete, somatotopically
              organized corticospinal projections were identified. Three
              separate corticospinal projections originated in frontal cortex.
              The first projected mostly from area 4 (approximately 35\% of the
              total contralateral neuron population), but also from the
              adjacent dorsolateral area 6a alpha (approximately 6\% of total).
              The second large corticospinal projection (approximately 15\% of
              total) originated in the supplementary motor area and a third
              small projection (approximately 2.6\% of total) projected from
              the ``postarcuate'' cortex. Two separate corticospinal neuron
              populations were identified in areas 24 (approximately 6\% of
              total) and 23 (approximately 4\% of total) of the cingulate
              cortex. Thus, nearly 70\% of the contralateral corticospinal
              projection originated in frontal and cingulate cortex. At the
              boundary between the primary motor and somatosensory cortex there
              was a sharp change in the pattern of projections. Only
              approximately 2.2\% of the contralateral corticospinal projection
              originated in area 3a, rising to approximately 9\% in areas 3b/1,
              and approximately 13\% in areas 2/5. The projections from SII and
              insula totaled 3.4\%. Ipsilateral and contralateral corticospinal
              projection patterns were similar, but the ipsilateral projection
              was only approximately 8.1\% of that from the contralateral
              cortex. Each corticospinal neuron population had terminals in the
              intermediate zone of all spinal segments; additionally, there
              were ventral horn projections from the primary motor and
              cingulate cortex, and dorsal horn projections from the
              somatosensory cortex. Recognizing a number of separate
              populations of corticospinal neurons in the frontal, parietal,
              and insular cortex, each with unique thalamic and cortical
              inputs, and each of which has continuous access to all spinal
              motoneuron populations, underlines the importance of cortical and
              spinal connections linking them and coordinating their action. No
              coherent model of the cortical control of limb movements that
              incorporates this functional anatomy yet exists.",

              recently developed and validated models for predicting survival

              based on age and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
              score assessed within 6 hours after stroke. Herein we demonstrate
              the applicability of our models in an independent sample of
              patients from controlled clinical trials. METHODS: The prognostic
              models were used to predict survival and functional recovery in
              5419 patients from the Virtual International Stroke Trials
              Archive (VISTA). Furthermore, we tried to improve the accuracy by
              adapting intercepts and estimating new model parameters. RESULTS:
              The original models were able to correctly classify 70.4\%
              (survival) and 72.9\% (functional recovery) of patients. Because
              the prediction was slightly pessimistic for patients in the
              controlled trials, adapting the intercept improved the accuracy
              to 74.8\% (survival) and 74.0\% (functional recovery). Novel

              provide statistical comparisons of behavioral test scores in
              patients with and without a lesion on a voxel by voxel basis.
              More recently, multivariate lesion symptom mapping (MLSM) methods
              have been developed that consider the effects of all lesioned
              voxels in one model simultaneously. In the current study, we
              provide a much-needed systematic comparison of several ULSM and
              MLSM methods, using both synthetic and real data to identify the
              potential strengths and weaknesses of both approaches. We tested
              the spatial precision of each LSM method for both single and dual
              (network type) anatomical target simulations across anatomical
              target location, sample size, noise level, and lesion smoothing.
              Additionally, we performed false positive simulations to identify
              the characteristics associated with each method's spurious
              findings. Simulations showed no clear superiority of either ULSM
              or MLSM methods overall, but rather highlighted specific
              advantages of different methods. No single method produced a
              thresholded LSM map that exclusively delineated brain regions
              associated with the target behavior. Thus, different LSM methods
              are indicated, depending on the particular study design, specific
              hypotheses, and sample size. Overall, we recommend the use of
              both ULSM and MLSM methods in tandem to enhance confidence in the
              results: Brain foci identified as significant across both types

              Because brain function is a result of coherent activations of a
              collection of functionally related voxels, lesion-symptom
              relations are generally contributed by multiple voxels
              simultaneously. Although voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping
              (VLSM) has made substantial contributions to the understanding of
              brain-behavior relationships, a better understanding of the
              brain-behavior relationship contributed by multiple brain regions
              needs a multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (MLSM). The purpose
              of this artilce was to develop an MLSM using a machine
              learning-based multivariate regression algorithm: support vector
              regression (SVR). In the proposed SVR-LSM, the symptom relation
              to the entire lesion map as opposed to each isolated voxel is
              modeled using a nonlinear function, so the intervoxel
              correlations are intrinsically considered, resulting in a
              potentially more sensitive way to examine lesion-symptom
              relationships. To explore the relative merits of VLSM and SVR-LSM
              we used both approaches in the analysis of a synthetic dataset.
              SVR-LSM showed much higher sensitivity and specificity for
              detecting the synthetic lesion-behavior relations than VLSM. When
              applied to lesion data and language measures from patients with
              brain damages, SVR-LSM reproduced the essential pattern of
              previous findings identified by VLSM and showed higher
              sensitivity than VLSM for identifying the lesion-behavior
              relations. Our data also showed the possibility of using lesion

  abstract = "Measures of brain activation (e.g., changes in scalp electrical
              potentials) have become the most popular method for inferring
              brain function. However, examining brain disruption (e.g.,
              examining behavior after brain injury) can complement activation
              studies. Activation techniques identify regions involved with a
              task, whereas disruption techniques are able to discover which
              regions are crucial for a task. Voxel-based lesion mapping can be
              used to determine relationships between behavioral measures and
              the location of brain injury, revealing the function of brain
              regions. Lesion mapping can also correlate the effectiveness of
              neurosurgery with the location of brain resection, identifying
              optimal surgical targets. Traditionally, voxel-based lesion
              mapping has employed the chi-square test when the clinical
              measure is binomial and the Student's t test when measures are
              continuous. Here we suggest that the Liebermeister approach for
              binomial data is more sensitive than the chi-square test. We also
              suggest that a test described by Brunner and Munzel is more

              and neuropsychological data often violate the assumptions of the

              faced when trying to predict an individual's functional outcome
              after stroke on the basis of lesion site. A primary goal is to
              find lesion-outcome associations that are consistently observed
              in large populations of stroke patients because consistent
              associations maximise confidence in future individualised
              predictions. To understand and control multiple sources of
              inter-patient variability, we need to systematically investigate
              each contributing factor and how each factor depends on other
              factors. This requires very large cohorts of patients, who differ
              from one another in typical and measurable ways, including lesion
              site, lesion size, functional outcome and time post stroke (weeks
              to decades). These multivariate investigations are complex,
              particularly when the contributions of different variables
              interact with one another. Machine learning algorithms can help
              to identify the most influential variables and indicate
              dependencies between different factors. Multivariate lesion
              analyses are needed to understand how the effect of damage to one
              brain region depends on damage or preservation in other brain
              regions. Such data-led investigations can reveal predictive
              relationships between lesion site and outcome. However, to
              understand and improve the predictions we need explanatory models
              of the neural networks and degenerate pathways that support
              functions of interest. This will entail integrating the results

              acute ischemic stroke published between January 1995 and December

              sustained, this relationship is attenuated from the acute to
              chronic phases. We investigated the possibility that motor
              impairment and response to constraint-induced movement therapy in
              patients with chronic stroke may relate more strongly to the
              structural integrity of brain structures remote from the lesion
              than to measures of overt tissue damage. METHODS: Voxel-based
              morphometry analysis was performed on MRI scans from 80 patients
              with chronic stroke to investigate whether variations in gray
              matter density were correlated with extent of residual motor
              impairment or with constraint-induced movement therapy-induced
              motor recovery. RESULTS: Decreased gray matter density in
              noninfarcted motor regions was significantly correlated with
              magnitude of residual motor deficit. In addition, reduced gray

              time-consuming and open to bias, with an automated abnormal
              tissue detection method in measuring corticospinal tract-infarct
              overlap volumes in chronic stroke patients to help predict motor
              outcome. METHODS: Using diffusion tensor imaging and
              probabilistic tractography, 4 corticospinal tracts from the
              primary motor cortex, dorsal and ventral premotor cortices, and
              supplementary motor area to the ipsilateral lower pons were
              reconstructed in 23 healthy controls. Tract-infarct overlap
              volume of each of the 4 corticospinal tracts was determined by
              overlapping the patients' lesions onto the control tract
              templates, using both manually and automatically defined infarcts
              in 51 patients. Correlations with upper limb motor impairment
              were assessed and both methods were directly compared using
              intraclass correlations (ICC). RESULTS: Greater impairment was
              seen in patients with greater corticospinal tract-infarct overlap
              with either method (rmanual range = 0.32-0.46; rautomated range =

              good to excellent for all 4 corticospinal tracts (ICC range =

              clinically important for planning treatment and for
              stratification in restorative clinical trials. In relation to the
              upper limbs, the main predictor of outcome is initial severity,
              with patients who present with mild to moderate impairment
              regaining about 70\% of their initial impairment by 3 months
              post-stroke. However, in those with severe presentations, this
              proportional recovery applies in only about half, with the other
              half experiencing poor recovery. The reasons for this failure to
              recover are not established although the extent of corticospinal
              tract damage is suggested to be a contributory factor. In this
              study, we investigated 30 patients with chronic stroke who had
              presented with severe upper limb impairment and asked whether it
              was possible to differentiate those with a subsequent good or
              poor recovery of the upper limb based solely on a T1-weighted
              structural brain scan. Methods A support vector machine approach
              using voxel-wise lesion likelihood values was used to show that
              it was possible to classify patients as good or poor recoverers
              with variable accuracy depending on which brain regions were used
              to perform the classification. Results While considering damage
              within a corticospinal tract mask resulted in 73\% classification
              accuracy, using other (non-corticospinal tract) motor areas
              provided 87\% accuracy, and combining both resulted in 90\%
              accuracy. Conclusion This proof of concept approach highlights
              the relative importance of different anatomical structures in
              supporting post-stroke upper limb motor recovery and points

              T1-weighted structural MRI in 33 chronic patients with stroke
              with either purely subcortical lesions (SC, n=19) or lesions

              lesion likelihood to upper limb motor deficit. Among 5 brain
              regions of interest, the brain region with the greatest
              contribution to motor deficit was determined for each subgroup.
              RESULTS: The corticospinal tract was most likely to be damaged in
              both subgroups. However, while damage in the corticospinal tract
              was the best indicator of motor deficit in the SC patients, motor

              outcome for people with severe motor impairment, as both clinical
              tests and corticospinal tract (CST) microstructure may not
              reliably indicate severe motor impairment. Here, we test whether
              imaging biomarkers beyond the CST relate to severe upper limb
              impairment post-stroke by evaluating white matter microstructure
              in the corpus callosum (CC). In an international, multisite
              hypothesis-generating observational study we determined if: a)
              CST asymmetry index can differentiate between individuals with
              mild-moderate and severe upper limb impairment; and b) CC
              biomarkers relate to upper limb impairment within individuals
              with severe impairment post-stroke. We hypothesised that CST
              asymmetry index would differentiate between mild-moderate and
              severe impairment, but CC microstructure would relate to motor
              outcome for individuals with severe upper limb impairment.
              METHODS: Seven cohorts with individual diffusion imaging and
              motor impairment (Fugl Meyer-Upper Limb) data were pooled.
              Hand-drawn regions-of-interest were used to seed probabilistic
              tractography for CST (ipsilesional/contralesional) and CC
              (prefrontal/premotor/motor/sensory/posterior) tracts. Our main
              imaging measure was mean fractional anisotropy. Linear
              mixed-effect regression explored relationships between candidate
              biomarkers and motor impairment, controlling for observations
              nested within cohorts, as well as age, sex, time post-stroke and
              lesion volume. RESULTS: Data from 110 individuals (30
              mild-moderate, 80 with severe motor impairment) were included. In
              the full sample, greater CST asymmetry index (i.e., lower
              fractional anisotropy in the ipsilesional hemisphere, p<.001) and
              larger lesion volume (p=.139) were negatively related to
              impairment. In the severe subgroup, CST asymmetry index was not
              reliably associated with impairment across models. Instead,
              lesion volume and CC microstructure explained impairment in the
              severe group beyond CST asymmetry index (p's<.010). CONCLUSIONS:
              Within a large cohort of individuals with severe upper limb
              impairment, CC microstructure related to motor outcome
              post-stroke. Our findings demonstrate that CST microstructure
              does relate to upper limb outcome across the full range of motor
              impairment but was not reliably associated within the severe
              subgroup. Therefore, CC microstructure may provide a promising

              lesion-symptom relationships for symptoms caused by white matter
              disconnection. It uses MRI-based fiber tracking in healthy
              subjects seeded from patient's focal brain lesions. Resulting
              individual disconnection maps can then be statistically
              associated with symptoms. Despite increasing use in the recent
              years, the validity of this approach remains to be investigated.
              In this study, we validated both, our own implementation and the
              implementation provided within BCBtoolkit. For technical
              validation, we used simulated symptoms based on overlap of 70
              real stroke lesions with tracts from a white matter atlas. For
              clinical validation, paresis scores and lesions from 316 patients
              with stroke were used. We found that voxelwise disconnection
              mapping is technically valid and outperforms the standard
              voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach for symptoms caused
              by white matter disconnection. Supporting its clinical validity
              and utility, we were able to reproduce the known association
              between corticospinal tract damage and contralateral hemiparesis.
              In addition, we demonstrate that the validity can be
              substantially diminished by relatively minor methodological
              changes. Based on these results, we derive methodological
              recommendations for the future use of voxelwise disconnection

  abstract = "Lesion to symptom mapping (LSM) is a crucial tool for
              understanding the causality of brain-behavior relationships. The
              analyses are typically performed by applying statistical methods
              on individual brain voxels (VLSM), a method called the
              mass-univariate approach. Several authors have shown that VLSM
              suffers from limitations that may decrease the accuracy and
              reliability of the findings, and have proposed the use of
              multivariate methods to overcome these limitations. In this
              study, we propose a multivariate optimization technique known as
              sparse canonical correlation analysis for neuroimaging (SCCAN)
              for lesion to symptom mapping. To validate the method and compare
              it with mass-univariate results, we used data from 131 patients
              with chronic stroke lesions in the territory of the middle
              cerebral artery, and created synthetic behavioral scores based on
              the lesion load of 93 brain regions (putative functional units).
              LSM analyses were performed with univariate VLSM or SCCAN, and
              the accuracy of the two methods was compared in terms of both
              overlap and displacement from the simulated functional areas.
              Overall, SCCAN produced more accurate results - higher dice
              overlap and smaller average displacement - compared to VLSM. This
              advantage persisted at different sample sizes (N = 20-131) and
              different multiple comparison corrections (false discovery rate,
              FDR; Bonferroni; permutation-based family wise error rate, FWER).
              These findings were replicated with a fully automated SCCAN
              routine that relied on cross-validated predictive accuracy to
              find the optimal sparseness value. Simulations of one, two, and
              three brain regions showed a systematic advantage of SCCAN over
              VLSM; under no circumstance could VLSM exceed the accuracy
              obtained with SCCAN. When considering functional units composed
              of multiple brain areas VLSM identified fewer areas than SCCAN.
              The investigation of real scores of aphasia severity (aphasia
              quotient and picture naming) showed that SCCAN could accurately
              identify known language-critical areas, while VLSM either
              produced diffuse maps (FDR correction) or few scattered voxels
              (FWER correction). Overall, this study shows that a multivariate
              method, such as, SCCAN, outperforms VLSM in a number of
              scenarios, including functional dependency on single or multiple
              areas, different sample sizes, different multi-area combinations,
              and different thresholding mechanisms (FWER, Bonferroni, FDR).
              These results support previous claims that multivariate methods
              are in general more accurate than mass-univariate approaches, and
              should be preferred over traditional VLSM approaches. All the
              methods described in this study are available in the newly
              developed LESYMAP package for R.",

              have recently described a novel approach for lesion-behavior
              mapping (LBM), referred to as Anatomo-Clinical Overlapping Maps
              (AnaCOM). Conventional voxelwise LBM tools apply statistics to
              contrast behavioral performance of patients with lesions that
              encompass given voxels to control patients where these voxels are
              spared. In contrast, AnaCOM contrasts performance of patients
              with injury involving given voxels to the performance of
              neurologically healthy participants. The authors correctly note
              that their procedure can offer substantially more statistical
              power than conventional LBM methods. We compared AnaCOM to
              conventional LBM techniques by examining hemiparesis (a common
              consequence of stroke) as the behavior of interest. We found that
              AnaCOM detected many regions of the middle cerebral artery
              territory not associated with the motor system. We suggest that
              conventional LBM techniques detect regions that are damaged in
              patients with a deficit while spared in those without a deficit,
              while AnaCOM detects regions that are associated with a deficit.
              Therefore, this new measure may offer poor specificity.
              Furthermore, on theoretical grounds we suggest that
              permutation-based thresholding will be a more sensitive method
              for controlling familywise error than the method of counting
              lesion-overlap clusters used by AnaCOM. Finally, we note that the
              within group variability tends to be smaller for neurologically
              healthy controls than in neurological patients, due to ceiling
              effects. Therefore, we suggest that nonparametric measures or the
              Welch's t-test are more appropriate than the conventional pooled
              variance t-test used by AnaCOM.",

              matter integrity in neurological patients by diffusion-weighted
              magnetic resonance imaging bears conceptual limitations and is
              not widely applicable, as it requires imaging-compatible patients

              indirect estimation of structural disconnection offers an elegant
              and economical alternative. For this approach, a patient's
              structural lesion information and normative connectome data are
              combined to estimate different measures of lesion-induced
              structural disconnection. Using one of several toolboxes, this
              method is relatively easy to implement and is even available to

              localising function in the human brain. As the highest court of
              appeal where competing theories of cerebral function conflict, it
              ought to be held to the most stringent inferential standards.
              Though at first sight elegantly transferable, the mass-univariate
              statistical framework popularized by functional imaging is
              demonstrably ill-suited to the task, both theoretically and
              empirically. The critical difficulty lies with the handling of
              the data's intrinsically high dimensionality. Conceptual opacity
              and computational complexity lead lesion-deficit mappers to
              neglect two distinct sets of anatomical interactions: those
              between areas unified by function, and those between areas
              unified by the natural pattern of pathological damage. Though
              both are soluble through high-dimensional multivariate analysis,
              the consequences of ignoring them are radically different. The
              former will bleach and coarsen a picture of the functional
              anatomy that is nonetheless broadly faithful to reality; the
              latter may alter it beyond all recognition. That the field
              continues to cling to mass-univariate methods suggests the latter
              problem is misidentified with the former, and that their
              distinction is in need of elaboration. We further argue that the
              vicious effects of lesion-driven interactions are not limited to
              anatomical localisation but will inevitably degrade purely
              predictive models of function such as those conceived for
              clinical prognostic use. Finally, we suggest there is a great

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The supply territories of main cerebral arteries are
              predominantly identified based on distribution of infarct lesions
              in patients with large arterial occlusion; whereas, there is no
              consensus atlas regarding the supply territories of smaller
              end-arteries. In this study, we applied a data-driven approach to
              construct a stroke atlas of the brain using hierarchical density
              clustering in large number of infarct lesions, assuming that
              voxels/regions supplied by a common end-artery tend to infarct
              together. METHODS: A total of 793 infarct lesions on MRI scans of
              458 patients were segmented and coregistered to MNI-152 standard
              brain space. Applying a voxel-wise data-driven hierarchical
              density clustering algorithm, we identified those voxels that
              were most likely to be part of same infarct lesions in our
              dataset. A step-wise clustering scheme was applied, where the
              clustering threshold was gradually decreased to form the first 20
              mother (>50 cm3) or main (1-50 cm3) clusters in addition to any
              possible number of tiny clusters (<1 cm3); and then, any
              resultant mother clusters were iteratively subdivided using the
              same scheme. Also, in a randomly selected 2/3 subset of our
              cohort, a bootstrapping cluster analysis with 100 permutations
              was performed to assess the statistical robustness of proposed
              clusters. RESULTS: Approximately 91\% of the MNI-152 brain mask
              was covered by 793 infarct lesions across patients. The covered
              area of brain was parcellated into 4 mother, 16 main, and 123
              tiny clusters at the first hierarchy level. Upon iterative
              clustering subdivision of mother clusters, the brain tissue was
              eventually parcellated into 1 mother cluster (62.6 cm3), 181 main
              clusters (total volume 1107.3 cm3), and 917 tiny clusters (total
              volume of 264.8 cm3). In bootstrap analysis, only 0.12\% of
              voxels, were labelled as ``unstable'' - with a greater
              reachability distance in cluster scheme compared to their
              corresponding mean bootstrapped reachability distance. On visual
              assessment, the mother/main clusters were formed along supply
              territories of main cerebral arteries at initial hierarchical
              levels, and then tiny clusters emerged in deep white matter and
              gray matter nuclei prone to small vessel ischemic infarcts.
              CONCLUSIONS: Applying voxel-wise data-driven hierarchical density
              clustering on a large number of infarct lesions, we have
              parcellated the brain tissue into clusters of voxels that tend to
              be part of same infarct lesion, and presumably representing
              end-arterial supply territories. This hierarchical stroke atlas
              of the brain is shared publicly, and can potentially be applied
              for future infarct location-outcome analysis.",

              optimise model performance is well-informed feature selection and
              representation. However, different feature representation
              strategies were so far used, and it is not known what strategy is
              best for modelling purposes. The present study compared the three
              common main strategies: voxel-wise representation,
              lesion-anatomical componential feature reduction and region-wise
              atlas-based feature representation. We used multivariate,

  abstract = "Modelling behavioural deficits based on structural lesion imaging
              is a popular approach to map functions in the human brain, and
              efforts to translationally apply lesion-behaviour modelling to
              predict post-stroke outcomes are on the rise. The
              high-dimensional complexity of lesion data, however, evokes
              challenges in both lesion behaviour mapping and post stroke
              outcome prediction. This paper aims to deepen the understanding
              of this complexity by reframing it from the perspective of causal
              and non-causal dependencies in the data, and by discussing what
              this complexity implies for different data modelling approaches.
              By means of theoretical discussion and empirical examination,
              several common strategies and views are challenged, and future
              research perspectives are outlined. A main conclusion is that
              lesion-behaviour inference is subject to a lesion-anatomical bias
              that cannot be overcome by using multivariate models or any other
              algorithm that is blind to causality behind relations in the
              data. This affects the validity of lesion behaviour mapping and
              might even wrongfully identify paradoxical effects of
              lesion-induced functional facilitation - but, as this paper
              argues, only to a minor degree. Thus, multivariate lesion-brain
              inference appears to be a valuable tool to deepen our
              understanding of the human brain, but only because it takes into
              account the functional relation between brain areas. The
              perspective of causality and inter-variable dependence is further
              used to point out challenges in improving lesion behaviour
              models. Firstly, the dependencies in the data open up different
              possible strategies of data reduction, and considering those
              might improve post-stroke outcome prediction. Secondly, the role
              of non-topographical causal predictors of post stroke behaviour
              is discussed. The present article argues that, given these
              predictors, different strategies are required in the evaluation
              of model quality in lesion behaviour mapping and post stroke
              outcome prediction.",

              kinematics. Effects were compared against two control stimulation
              sites, i.e., contralesional M1 and a sham stimulation condition.
              We found that patients with good motor outcome compared to
              patients with more substantial residual deficits featured
              increased resting-state connectivity between ipsilesional aIPS
              and contralesional aIPS as well as between ipsilesional aIPS and

              between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional M1 as well as
              ipsilesional aIPS and contralesional M1 correlated with better
              motor performance across tasks. TMS interference at individual
              aIPS and M1 coordinates led to differential effects depending on
              the motor task that was tested, i.e., index finger-tapping, rapid
              pointing movements, or a reach-grasp-lift task. Interfering with
              contralesional aIPS deteriorated the accuracy of grasping,
              especially in patients featuring higher connectivity between
              ipsi- and contralesional aIPS. In contrast, interference with the
              contralesional M1 led to impaired grasping speed in patients
              featuring higher connectivity between bilateral M1. These
              findings suggest differential roles of contralesional M1 and aIPS
              for distinct aspects of recovered hand motor function, depending
              on the reorganization of interhemispheric connectivity.",

              learning in structural imaging to investigate diseases that
              involve brain injury presents an additional challenge, especially

              data from anatomical images in a way that translates brain damage
              information into features to be used as input to learning
              algorithms is still an open question. One of the most common
              approaches to capture regional information from brain injury is
              to obtain the lesion load per region (i.e. the proportion of
              voxels in anatomical structures that are considered to be
              damaged). However, no systematic evaluation has yet been
              performed to compare this approach with using patterns of voxels
              (i.e. considering each voxel as a single feature). In this paper
              we compared both approaches applying Gaussian Process Regression
              to decode motor scores in 50 chronic stroke patients based solely
              on data derived from structural MRI. For both approaches we
              compared different ways to delimit anatomical areas: regions of

              than quantifying the lesion load per region. In particular, from
              the different ways to delimit anatomical areas compared, the best
              performance was obtained with a combination of a range of
              cortical and subcortical motor areas as well as the corticospinal

  abstract = "Hemiparesis is a common consequence of stroke to the primary
              motor system. Previous studies suggested that damage to
              additional brain areas might play a causal role in the occurrence
              and severity of hemiparesis and its recovery. Knowledge of these
              regions might be applied in the creation of imaging biomarkers
              for motor outcome prediction if lesion information from such
              areas carries predictive value. We assessed acute and chronic
              paresis of the upper limb in 102 patients with unilateral stroke.
              In a first experiment, the neural correlates of acute and chronic
              upper limb paresis were mapped by lesion behaviour mapping.
              Following the same approach, a lesion biomarker of corticospinal
              tract (CST) damage was mapped. This analysis served as an
              artificial control condition as the biomarker, by definition, is
              only causally related to damage of the CST. Mapping acute or
              chronic upper limb paresis implicated areas outside of the
              primary motor system. Likewise, mapping the CST lesion biomarker
              implicated several areas outside of the CST with high
              correspondence to areas associated with upper limb paresis.
              Damage to areas outside of the primary motor system thus might,
              to some degree, not play a causal role in hemiparesis. In a
              second experiment, we showed that lesion information from these
              areas outside of the primary motor system can be used to predict
              motor outcome. This was even the case for the CST lesion
              biomarker. Although the only causal source underlying the CST
              lesion biomarker was damage to the CST, lesion information that
              mainly included non-CST regions was able to predict the biomarker
              (non-significantly) better than information taken from only the
              CST itself. These findings suggest that simple theory-based
              biomarkers or qualitative rules to infer post-stroke outcome from
              imaging data might perform sub-optimally, as they do not consider
              the complexity of lesion data. Instead, high-dimensional models
              with data-driven feature selection strategies might be required.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Infarct size on T2-weighted MRI
              correlates only modestly with outcome, particularly for small
              strokes. This may be largely because of differences in the
              locations of infarcts and consequently in the functional pathways
              that are damaged. To test this hypothesis quantitatively, we
              developed a ``mask'' of the corticospinal pathway to determine
              whether the extent of stroke intersection with the pathway would
              be more closely related to clinical motor deficit and axonal
              injury in the descending motor pathways than total stroke lesion
              volume. METHODS: Eighteen patients were studied > or =1 month
              after first ischemic stroke that caused a motor deficit by use of
              brain T2-weighted imaging, MR spectroscopic (MRS) measurements of
              the neuronal marker compound N-acetyl aspartate in the posterior
              limb of the internal capsule, and motor impairment and disability
              measures. A corticospinal mask based on neuroanatomic landmarks
              was generated from a subset of the MRI data. The maximum
              proportion of the cross-sectional area of this mask occupied by
              stroke was determined for each patient after all brain images
              were transformed into a common stereotaxic brain space. RESULTS:
              There was a significant linear relationship between the maximum
              proportional cross-sectional area of the corticospinal mask
              occupied by stroke and motor deficit (r(2)=0.82, P<0.001),
              whereas the relationship between the total stroke volume and
              motor deficit was better described by a cubic curve (r(2)=0.76,
              P<0.001). Inspection of the data plots showed that the total
              stroke volume discriminated poorly between smaller strokes with
              regard to the extent of associated motor deficit, whereas the
              maximum proportion of the mask cross-sectional area occupied by
              stroke appeared to be a more discriminatory marker of motor
              deficit and also N-acetyl aspartate reduction. CONCLUSIONS:
              Segmentation of functional motor pathways on MRI allows
              estimation of the extent of damage specifically to that pathway
              by the stroke lesion. The extent of stroke intersection with the
              motor pathways was more linearly related to the magnitude of
              motor deficit than total lesion volume and appeared to be a
              better discriminator between small strokes with regard to motor
              deficit. This emphasizes the importance of the anatomic
              relationship of the infarct to local structures in determining
              functional impairment. Prospective studies are necessary to
              assess whether this approach would allow improved early
              estimation of prognosis after stroke.",

              index finger tapping (control subjects, right; patients,
              recovered side). RESULTS: On functional MRI, stroke patients with
              right arm involvement showed (1) significantly smaller activation
              in contralateral motor cortexes compared with control subjects;
              (2) smaller ipsilateral (nonstroke) premotor and larger
              contralateral (stroke-side) sensorimotor activation compared with
              patients with left arm involvement, although electromyogram
              across groups was similar; and (3) 2.7-fold-larger contralateral

              course and severity of chronic post-stroke cognitive and motor
              outcomes, as the ability to do so would inform treatment and
              rehabilitation strategies. However, it remains difficult to make
              accurate predictions about chronic post-stroke outcomes due, in
              large part, to high inter-individual variability in recovery and
              a reliance on clinical heuristics rather than empirical methods.
              The neuroanatomical location of a stroke is a key variable
              associated with long-term outcomes, and because lesion location
              can be derived from routinely collected clinical neuroimaging
              data there is an opportunity to use this information to make
              empirically based predictions about post-stroke deficits. For
              example, lesion location can be compared to statistically
              weighted multivariate lesion-behavior maps (LBMs) of
              neuroanatomical regions that, when damaged, are associated with
              specific deficits based on aggregated outcome data from large
              cohorts. Here, our goal was to evaluate whether we can leverage
              LBMs based on data from two large cohorts of individuals with
              focal brain lesions to make predictions of 12-month cognitive and
              motor outcomes in an independent sample of stroke patients.
              Further, we evaluated whether we could augment these predictions
              by estimating the structural and functional networks disrupted in
              association with each LBM through the use of structural and
              functional lesion network mapping (sLNM \& fLNM, respectively),
              which use normative structural and functional connectivity data
              from neurologically healthy individuals to elucidate
              lesion-associated networks. We derived these brain network maps
              using the anatomical regions with the strongest association with
              impairment for each cognitive and motor outcome based on LBM
              results. These peak regional findings became the 'seeds' to
              generate networks, an approach that offers potentially greater
              precision compared to previously used single-lesion approaches.
              Next, in an independent sample, we quantified the overlap of each
              lesion location with the LBM, sLNM, and fLNM and evaluated how
              much variance each could explain in 12-month behavioral outcomes
              using a latent growth curve statistical model. We found that each
              lesion-deficit mapping modality was able to predict a
              statistically significant amount of variance in cognitive and
              motor outcomes. Both fLNM and sLNM were able to predict variance
              in 12-month outcomes beyond LBM. fLNM performed best for the
              prediction of language deficits, and sLNM performed best for the
              prediction of motor deficits. Altogether, these results support
              the notion that lesion location and lesion network mapping can be
              combined to improve the prediction of post-stroke deficits at
              12-months.",

              dimensionality reduction methods to build robust predictive
              models. In this work, we assess the ability of four well-known
              dimensionality reduction techniques to extract relevant features

              patients, which are then used to build a predictive model of the
              associated deficits based on cross-validated regularized
              regression. In particular, we investigated the prediction ability
              over different neuropsychological scores referring to language,

              Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) were the

  abstract = "Sustained attention is a limited resource which declines during
              daily tasks. Such decay is exacerbated in clinical and aging
              populations. Inhibition of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), using
              low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
              (LF-rTMS), can lead to an upregulation of functional
              communication within the attention network. Attributed to
              functional compensation for the inhibited node, this boost lasts
              for tens of minutes poststimulation. Despite the neural change,
              no behavioral correlate has been found in healthy subjects, a
              necessary direct evidence of functional compensation. To
              understand the functional significance of neuromodulatory induced
              fluctuations on attention, we sought to boost the impact of
              LF-rTMS to impact behavior. We controlled brain state prior to
              LF-rTMS using high-frequency transcranial random noise
              stimulation (HF-tRNS), shown to increase and stabilize neuronal
              excitability. Using fMRI-guided stimulation protocols combining
              HF-tRNS and LF-rTMS, we tested the poststimulation impact on
              sustained attention with multiple object tracking (MOT). While
              attention deteriorated across time in control conditions, HF-tRNS
              followed by LF-rTMS doubled sustained attention capacity to 94
              min. Multimethod stimulation was more effective when targeting
              right IPS, supporting specialized attention processing in the
              right hemisphere. Used in cognitive domains dependent on
              network-wide neural activity, this tool may cause lasting neural
              compensation useful for clinical rehabilitation.",

              whole hand fist closure movements. After a baseline scan,
              patients were stimulated with inhibitory 1-Hz rTMS applied over
              two different locations: (i) vertex (control stimulation) and
              (ii) primary motor cortex (M1) of the unaffected (contralesional)

              correlation structure of whole-brain regional activity. It is
              studied widely, both to gain insight into the brain's intrinsic
              organization but also to develop markers sensitive to changes in
              an individual's cognitive, clinical, and developmental state.
              Despite this, the origins and drivers of functional connectivity,
              especially at the level of densely sampled individuals, remain
              elusive. Here, we leverage novel methodology to decompose
              functional connectivity into its precise framewise contributions.
              Using two dense sampling datasets, we investigate the origins of
              individualized functional connectivity, focusing specifically on
              the role of brain network ``events'' -- short-lived and peaked
              patterns of high-amplitude cofluctuations. Here, we develop a
              statistical test to identify events in empirical recordings. We
              show that the patterns of cofluctuation expressed during events
              are repeated across multiple scans of the same individual and
              represent idiosyncratic variants of template patterns that are
              expressed at the group level. Lastly, we propose a simple model
              of functional connectivity based on event cofluctuations,
              demonstrating that group-averaged cofluctuations are suboptimal
              for explaining participant-specific connectivity. Our work
              complements recent studies implicating brief instants of
              high-amplitude cofluctuations as the primary drivers of static,
              whole-brain functional connectivity. Our work also extends those

              major component of the motor system through the corona radiata
              and internal capsule are well described in non-human primates,
              they have not been described fully in humans. Our study set out
              to map the trajectories of these connections in a group of
              healthy volunteers (8 male, 4 female; age range = 31-68 years,

              damage to corticofugal pathways in stroke patients (n = 3) by
              comparing the overlap between regions of subcortical white matter
              damage with the trajectories of the connections to each motor
              area. In a small series of case studies, we found that inferred

              responses, as assessed with functional MRI, in the ipsilesional

              corticospinal tract (CST) also receives fibers from dorsal and
              ventral premotor cortices and supplementary motor area, all of
              which might potentially contribute to motor function after
              stroke. We sought to quantify the microstructural integrity of
              CST originating from the hand representations in these 4 motor
              cortices separately and examined how these values related to hand
              motor impairment. METHODS: Probabilistic tractography from
              functional MRI-defined cortical sites demonstrated continuous CST
              originating from hand representations within each motor area in a
              group of healthy subjects. Microstructural integrity for each
              tract was calculated using fractional anisotropy at the level of
              the posterior limb of the internal capsule in a group of patients
              with chronic stroke. RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy was reduced
              in all 4 CSTs in the affected hemisphere. Grip strength
              correlated with the integrity of the CSTs originating from
              primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices, whereas, in a
              multiple regression model, the latter improved the ability of
              primary motor cortex CST to explain variability in grip strength.
              CONCLUSION: Handgrip critically depends on the CST originating in
              primary motor cortex but microstructural integrity of CST
              originating from premotor cortices appears to play a role in
              supporting motor function after stroke.",

              unclear. In this prospective cohort study, 19 severely affected
              first-ever stroke patients (mean age 74 years, 12 females) were
              analysed which underwent resting-state functional MRI and

              Clinical evaluation of neurological and motor impairment as well
              as global disability was repeated after three and six months.
              Nineteen healthy participants of similar age and gender were also

              ipsilesional parietofrontal coupling between anterior
              intraparietal sulcus and the primary motor cortex in severely
              affected stroke patients (P < 0.003). This upregulation
              significantly contributed to correlative models explaining

              quantified by National Institute of Health Stroke Scale and

              of persistent deficits in the late subacute stage of recovery (P
              < 0.05). This study provides novel insights that parietofrontal
              networks of the ipsilesional hemisphere undergo neuroplastic

               nonsevere upper limb motor impairment over the first 3 to 6
               months after stroke, measured with the Fugl-Meyer Assessment
               (FMA), is approximately 0.7 times the initial impairment
               (?proportional recovery?). In contrast to patients with
               nonsevere hemiparesis, about 30\% of patients with an initial
               severe paresis do not show such recovery (?nonrecoverers?).
               Hence it was suggested that the proportional recovery rule (PRR)
               was a manifestation of a spontaneous mechanism that is present
               in all patients with mild-to-moderate paresis but only in some
               with severe paresis. Since the introduction of the PRR, it has
               subsequently been applied to other motor and nonmotor
               impairments. This more general investigation of the PRR has led
               to inconsistencies in its formulation and application, making it
               difficult to draw conclusions across studies and precipitating
               some cogent criticism. Here, we conduct a detailed comparison of
               the different studies reporting proportional recovery and, where
               appropriate, critique statistical methodology. On balance, we
               conclude that existing data in aggregate are largely consistent

               recovery; recent reports of its demise are exaggerated, as these
               excessively focus on the less conclusive issue of individual
               subject-level predictions. Moving forward, we suggest that
               methodological caution and new analytical approaches will be
               needed to confirm (or refute) a systematic character to
               spontaneous recovery from motor and other poststroke

               equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is

              research suggested it could enhance plasticity and enable greater
              behavioral recovery. However, several studies have now identified
              substantial intersubject variability in response to tDCS and
              clinical trials revealed insufficient evidence of treatment
              effectiveness. A possible explanation for the varied and negative
              findings is that the physiologic model of stroke recovery that
              researchers have used to guide the application of tDCS-based
              treatments in stroke is overly simplistic and does not account
              for stroke heterogeneity or known determinants that affect the

              function. However, no software package exists to process mpMRI
              data of the spinal cord. Despite the numerous clinical needs for
              such advanced mpMRI protocols (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord
              injury, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, etc.), researchers have
              been developing specific tools that, while necessary, do not

              function from fMRI data frequently require the specification of
              regions of interests (ROIs). Several analyses have relied on
              atlases derived from anatomical or cyto-architectonic boundaries
              to specify these ROIs, yet the suitability of atlases for resting
              state functional connectivity (FC) studies has yet to be
              established. This article introduces a data-driven method for
              generating an ROI atlas by parcellating whole brain resting-state
              fMRI data into spatially coherent regions of homogeneous FC.
              Several clustering statistics are used to compare methodological
              trade-offs as well as determine an adequate number of clusters.
              Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of the parcellation
              atlas against four ROI atlases (Talairach and Tournoux,
              Harvard-Oxford, Eickoff-Zilles, and Automatic Anatomical
              Labeling) and a random parcellation approach. The evaluated
              anatomical atlases exhibit poor ROI homogeneity and do not
              accurately reproduce FC patterns present at the voxel scale. In
              general, the proposed functional and random parcellations perform
              equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated. ROI size and
              hence the number of ROIs in a parcellation had the greatest
              impact on their suitability for FC analysis. With 200 or fewer
              ROIs, the resulting parcellations consist of ROIs with anatomic
              homology, and thus offer increased interpretability. Parcellation
              results containing higher numbers of ROIs (600 or 1,000) most
              accurately represent FC patterns present at the voxel scale and
              are preferable when interpretability can be sacrificed for
              accuracy. The resulting atlases and clustering software have been

              frontoparietal network had diminished structural integrity

              shared variance across tracts in the control, but not in the
              poststroke participants. A moderate to good relationship was
              found between ipsilesional T-M1 MD and affected hand HASTe score
              (r = - 0.62, p = 0.006) and less affected hand HASTe score (r = -

              ages 13-19) with varying severity of depressive symptoms
              completed a resting-state functional MRI scan. Functional
              networks were evaluated using co-activation pattern analysis to
              identify whole-brain states of spatial co-activation that
              recurred across participants and time. Measures included: dwell
              time (proportion of scan spent in that network state),
              persistence (volume-to-volume maintenance of a network state),
              and transitions (frequency of moving from state A to state B).
              Analyses tested associations between depression or trait
              rumination and dynamics of network states involving frontoinsular
              and default network systems. Results indicated that adolescents
              showing increased dwell time in, and persistence of, a
              frontoinsular-default network state involving insula,
              dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex, and posterior regions
              of default network, reported more severe symptoms of depression.
              Further, adolescents who transitioned more frequently between the
              frontoinsular-default state and a prototypical default network
              state reported higher depression. Increased dominance and
              transition frequency of frontoinsular-default network states were
              also associated with higher rumination, and rumination mediated
              the associations between network dynamics and depression.
              Findings support a model in which abnormal frontoinsular dynamics
              confer vulnerability to maladaptive introspection, which in turn
              contributes to symptoms of adolescent depression.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Recent studies related to assessing functional
              connectivity (FC) in resting-state functional magnetic resonance
              imaging have revealed that the resulting connectivity patterns
              exhibit considerable fluctuations (dynamic FC [dFC]). A widely
              applied method for quantifying dFC is the sliding window
              technique. According to this method, the data are divided into
              segments with the same length (window size) and a correlation
              metric is employed to assess the connectivity within these
              segments, whereby the window size is often empirically chosen.
              METHODS: In this study, we rigorously investigate the assessment
              of dFC using the sliding window approach. Specifically, we
              perform a detailed comparison between different correlation
              metrics, including Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation,
              Pearson and Spearman partial correlation, Mutual Information
              (MI), Variation of Information (VI), Kullback-Leibler divergence,
              Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives and Inverse Covariance.
              RESULTS: Using test-retest datasets, we show that MI and VI
              yielded the most consistent results by achieving high reliability
              with respect to dFC estimates for different window sizes.
              Subsequent hypothesis testing, based on multivariate phase
              randomization surrogate data generation, allowed the
              identification of dynamic connections between the posterior
              cingulate cortex and regions in the frontal lobe and inferior
              parietal lobes, which were overall in agreement with previous
              studies. CONCLUSIONS: In the case of MI and VI, a window size of
              at least 120 s was found to be necessary for detecting dFC for
              some of the previously identified dynamically connected regions.",

              tissue. In rodent models, sensory and motor cortical
              representations have been shown to remap onto intact tissue
              around the lesion site, but remapping to more distal sites (e.g.
              in the contralesional hemisphere) has also been observed. Resting

              study compensatory network adaptations in humans, but mechanisms
              and time course of motor recovery are not well understood. Here,
              we examine longitudinal FC in 23 first-episode ischemic pontine
              stroke patients and utilize a graph matching approach to identify
              patterns of functional connectivity reorganization during
              recovery. We quantified functional reorganization between several
              intervals ranging from 1 week to 6 months following stroke, and
              demonstrated that the areas that undergo functional
              reorganization most frequently are in cerebellar/subcortical
              networks. Brain regions with more structural and functional
              connectome disruption due to the stroke also had more remapping

              correlated with the extent of motor recovery in the early to late
              subacute phases, and furthermore, individuals with greater
              baseline motor impairment demonstrate more extensive early
              subacute functional reorganization (from one to two weeks
              post-stroke) and this reorganization correlates with better motor
              recovery at 6 months. Taken together, these results suggest that
              our graph matching approach can quantify recovery-relevant,

              disorder (OCD) are classified as two chronic psychiatric
              disorders with high comorbidity rate and shared clinical
              symptoms. Abnormal spontaneous brain activity within the
              cortical-striatal neural circuits has been observed in both
              disorders. However, it is unclear if the common or distinct
              neural abnormalities underlie the neurobiological substrates in
              the resting state. Methods: Resting-state fMRI data were
              collected from 88 patients with SCZ, 58 patients with OCD, and 72
              healthy control subjects. First, we examined differences in
              amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) among three
              groups. Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis
              with the brain region that showed different ALFF as the seed was
              then conducted to identify the changes in brain networks.
              Finally, we examined the correlation between the altered
              activities and clinical symptoms. Results: Both the patients with
              SCZ and OCD showed increased ALFF in the right hippocampus and
              decreased ALFF in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). SCZ
              patients exhibited increased ALFF in the left caudate
              [voxel-level family-wise error (FWE) P < 0.05] and decreased rsFC
              between the left caudate and right cerebellum, which correlated
              with positive symptoms. The left caudate showed increased rsFC
              with the right thalamus and bilateral supplementary motor complex
              (SMC) in OCD patients (cluster-level FWE P < 0.05). Conclusions:
              The hippocampus and PCC are common regions presenting abnormal
              local spontaneous neuronal activities in both SCZ and OCD, while
              the abnormality of the striatum can reflect the differences.
              Increased ALFF in the striatum and symptom-related weakened rsFC
              between the caudate and cerebellum showed SCZ specificity.
              Enhanced rsFC between the caudate and SMC may be a key
              characteristic in OCD. Our research shows the similarities and
              differences between the two diseases from the perspective of
              resting-state fMRI, which provides clues to understand the

              located outside this structure (e.g. pineal gland, quadrigeminal
              plate). Stimulation, delivered at a 60-Hz frequency for 2 s,
              evoked focal (single-joint) ipsilateral movements. Different
              regions were associated with the production of head (vermal
              lobule VI), face/mouth (hemispheric lobule VI) and lower-limb
              (hemispheric lobules VIIb-IX) responses. Upper-limb
              representations were more widely distributed. They intermingled
              with face/mouth representations in the superior posterior

              become an indispensable tool in neuroscientific research as it
              provides insights into brain organization. Connectomes are
              generated using different modalities such as diffusion MRI to
              capture structural organization of the brain or functional MRI to
              elaborate brain's functional organization. Understanding links
              between structural and functional organizations is crucial in
              explaining how observed behavior emerges from the underlying
              neurobiological mechanisms. Many studies have investigated how
              these two organizations relate to each other; however, we still
              lack a comparative understanding on how much variation should be
              expected in the two modalities, both between people and within a
              single person across scans. APPROACH: In this study, we
              systematically analyzed the consistency of connectomes, that is
              the similarity between connectomes in terms of individual
              connections between brain regions and in terms of overall network
              topology. We present a comprehensive study of consistency in
              connectomes for a single subject examined longitudinally and
              across a large cohort of subjects cross-sectionally, in structure
              and function separately. Within structural connectomes, we
              compared connectomes generated by different tracking algorithms,
              parcellations, edge weighting schemes, and edge pruning
              techniques. In functional connectomes, we compared full,
              positive, and negative connectivity separately along with
              thresholding of weak edges. We evaluated consistency using
              correlation (incorporating information at the level of individual
              edges) and graph matching accuracy (evaluating connectivity at
              the level of network topology). We also examined the consistency
              of connectomes that are generated using different communication
              schemes. MAIN RESULTS: Our results demonstrate varying degrees of
              consistency for the two modalities, with structural connectomes
              showing higher consistency than functional connectomes. Moreover,
              we observed a wide variation in consistency depending on how
              connectomes are generated. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study sets a
              reference point for consistency of connectome types, which is

              impairment. This raises an important question: how far does
              recovery of motor performance depend on the processes that
              precede movement execution involving the premotor and prefrontal
              cortex, rather than recovery of the corticospinal system alone?
              METHODS: We examined stroke patients with functional magnetic
              resonance imaging while they either imagined or executed a
              finger-thumb opposition sequence. In addition to classical
              analyses of regional activations, we studied neuroplasticity in
              terms of differential network connectivity using structural
              equation modeling. The study included 8 right-handed patients who
              had suffered a left-hemisphere subcortical ischemic stroke with
              paresis, and 13 age-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: With good
              functional recovery, the regional activations had returned to
              normal in patients. However, connectivity within the extended
              motor network remained abnormal. These abnormalities were seen
              predominantly during motor imagery and correlated with motor
              performance. INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that
              neuroplasticity can manifest itself as differences in
              connectivity among cortical areas remote from the infarct, rather
              than in the degree of regional activation. Connection strengths
              between nodes of the cortical motor network correlate with motor
              outcome. The altered organization of connectivity of the
              prefrontal areas may reflect the role of the prefrontal cortex in
              higher order planning of movement. Our results are relevant to
              the assessment and understanding of emerging physical and
              neurophysiological therapies for stroke rehabilitation.",

              brain regions to motor recovery after stroke have revealed
              conflicting results comprising both supporting and disturbing
              influences. Especially the relevance of contralesional brain
              regions beyond primary motor cortex (M1) has rarely been studied,
              particularly concerning the temporal dynamics post-stroke.
              METHODS: We, therefore, used online transcranial magnetic
              stimulation (TMS) interference to longitudinally assess the role
              of contralesional (right) frontoparietal areas for recovery of
              hand motor function after left hemispheric stroke: contralesional
              M1, contralesional dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), and
              contralesional anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Fourteen
              stroke patients and sixteen age-matched healthy subjects
              performed motor tasks of varying complexity with their (paretic)
              right hand. Motor performance was quantified using
              three-dimensional kinematic data. All patients were assessed
              twice, (i) in the first week, and (ii) after more than three
              months post-stroke. RESULTS: While we did not observe a
              significant effect of TMS interference on movement kinematics
              following the stimulation of contralesional M1 and dPMC in the
              first week post-stroke, we found improvements of motor
              performance upon interference with contralesional IPS across
              motor tasks early after stroke, an effect that persisted into the
              later phase. By contrast, for dPMC, TMS-induced deterioration of
              motor performance was only evident three months post-stroke,
              suggesting that a supportive role of contralesional premotor
              cortex might evolve with reorganization. CONCLUSION: We here
              highlight time-sensitive and region-specific effects of
              contralesional frontoparietal areas after left hemisphere stroke,

              (ARAT) as a measure of motor function. We used a seed-based
              rs-connectivity approach defining the motor (seed=contralesional
              primary motor cortex (M1)) and frontoparietal
              (seed=contralesional dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC))
              networks. We analyzed the rs-connectivity within each network
              (intra-network connectivity) and between both networks
              (inter-network connectivity), and performed correlations between:
              a) intra-network connectivity and motor assessment scores; b)
              inter-network connectivity and motor assessment scores. We found:
              a) Participants with high rs-connectivity within the motor
              network (between M1 and supplementary motor area) have higher
              CMSA-Hand stage (z=3.62, p=0.003) and higher ARAT score (z=3.41,
              p=0.02). Rs-connectivity within the motor network was not
              significantly correlated with CMSA-Arm stage (z=1.83, p>0.05); b)
              Participants with high rs-connectivity within the frontoparietal
              network (between DLPFC and mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex)
              have higher CMSA-Hand stage (z=3.64, p=0.01). Rs-connectivity
              within the frontoparietal network was not significantly
              correlated with CMSA-Arm stage (z=0.93, p=0.03) or ARAT score
              (z=2.53, p=0.05); and c) Participants with high rs-connectivity
              between motor and frontoparietal networks have higher CMSA-Hand
              stage (rs=0.54, p=0.01) and higher ARAT score (rs=0.54, p=0.009).
              Rs-connectivity between the motor and frontoparietal networks was
              not significantly correlated with CMSA-Arm stage (rs=0.34,
              p=0.13). Taken together, the connectivity within and between the
              motor and frontoparietal networks correlate with motor outcome
              post-stroke. The integrity of these regions may be important for
              an individual's motor outcome. Motor-frontoparietal connectivity

              promote motor skill acquisition in healthy subjects and patients.
              Although lesions of the common motor imagery and motor execution
              neural network are expected to impair motor imagery ability,
              functional equivalence appears to be at least partially preserved
              in stroke patients. AIM: To identify brain regions that are
              mandatory for preserved motor imagery ability after stroke.
              METHOD: Thirty-seven patients with hemiplegia after a first time
              stroke participated. Motor imagery ability was measured using a
              Motor Imagery questionnaire and temporal congruence test. A
              voxelwise lesion symptom mapping approach was used to identify
              neural correlates of motor imagery in this cohort within the
              first year post-stroke. RESULTS: Poor motor imagery vividness was
              associated with lesions in the left putamen, left ventral
              premotor cortex and long association fibers linking
              parieto-occipital regions with the dorsolateral premotor and
              prefrontal areas. Poor temporal congruence was otherwise linked
              to lesions in the more rostrally located white matter of the
              superior corona radiata. CONCLUSION: This voxel-based lesion
              symptom mapping study confirms the association between white
              matter tract lesions and impaired motor imagery ability, thus
              emphasizing the importance of an intact fronto-parietal network
              for motor imagery. Our results further highlight the crucial role
              of the basal ganglia and premotor cortex when performing motor

              accumulation of extracellular amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) plaques

              Resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) studies have provided links between
              these two observations in terms of disruption of default mode and
              task-positive resting-state networks (RSNs). Important insights
              underlying these disruptions were recently obtained by
              investigating dynamic fluctuations in RS-fMRI signals in old
              TG2576 mice (a mouse model of amyloidosis) using a set of
              quasi-periodic patterns (QPP). QPPs represent repeating
              spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity of predefined temporal
              length. In this article, we used an alternative methodology of
              co-activation patterns (CAPs) that represent instantaneous and
              transient brain configurations that are likely contributors to
              the emergence of commonly observed RSNs and QPPs. We followed a
              recently published approach for obtaining CAPs that divided all
              time frames, instead of those corresponding to supra-threshold
              activations of a seed region as done traditionally, to extract
              CAPs from RS-fMRI recordings in 10 TG2576 female mice and eight
              wild type littermates at 18 months of age. Subsequently, we
              matched the CAPs from the two groups using the Hungarian method
              and compared the temporal (duration, occurrence rate) and the
              spatial (lateralization of significantly co-activated and
              co-deactivated voxels) properties of matched CAPs. We found
              robust differences in the spatial components of matched CAPs.
              Finally, we used supervised learning to train a classifier using
              either the temporal or the spatial component of CAPs to
              distinguish the transgenic mice from the WT. We found that while
              duration and occurrence rates of all CAPs performed the
              classification with significantly higher accuracy than the
              chance-level, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals of
              significantly activated voxels from individual CAPs turned out to
              be a significantly better predictive feature demonstrating a
              near-perfect classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate
              resting-state co-activation patterns are a promising candidate in

  abstract = "It is well documented that massive dynamic information is
              contained in the resting-state fMRI. Recent studies have
              identified recurring states dominated by similar coactivation
              patterns (CAP) and revealed their temporal dynamics. However, the
              reproducibility and generalizability of the CAP analysis is
              unclear. To address this question, the effects of methodological
              pipelines on CAP are comprehensively evaluated in this study,
              including preprocessing, network construction, cluster number and
              three independent cohorts. The CAP state dynamics are
              characterized by fraction of time, persistence, counts, and
              transition probability. Results demonstrate six reliable CAP
              states and their dynamic characteristics are also reproducible.
              The state transition probability is found to be positively
              associated with the spatial similarity. Furthermore, the aberrant
              CAP in schizophrenia has been investigated by using the
              reproducible method on three cohorts. Schizophrenia patients
              spend less time in CAP states that involve the fronto-parietal
              network, but more time in CAP states that involve the default
              mode and salience network. The aberrant dynamic characteristics
              of CAP are correlated with the symptom severity. These results
              reveal the reproducibility and generalizability of the CAP
              analysis, which can provide novel insights into the
              neuropathological mechanism associated with aberrant brain

              coactivation patterns (CAPs) pairs with opposite coactivation
              profiles were identified, and the between-state transition
              probability was positively correlated with their spatial
              similarity. 2. Good spatial and temporal reproducibility and
              generalizability of CAPs were achieved under varied analytic
              methods and independent cohorts. 3. Schizophrenia patients showed
              altered temporal dynamics not only within the triple-network but
              also other primary and higher-order networks. \#\#\# Competing

              that the brain is remarkably active even in the absence of overt

              reproducible across subjects and follow the brain's established
              functional subdivision. Investigating the distribution of these

              obtaining a better understanding of the neural networks

              interaction between brain regions. It was recently proposed that
              spontaneous brain activity may be dominated by brief traces of
              activity, possibly originating from a neuronal avalanching
              phenomenon. Such traces may involve different subregions in a
              network at different times, potentially reflecting functionally
              relevant relationships that are not captured with conventional
              data analysis. To investigate this, we examined publicly
              available functional magnetic resonance imaging data with a
              dedicated analysis method and found indications that functional
              networks inferred from conventional correlation analysis may
              indeed be driven by activity at only a few critical time points.
              Subsequent analysis of the activity at these critical time points

              enables us to make direct comparisons of cofluctuations of
              network organization with fluctuations in the blood oxygen
              level-dependent (BOLD) time series. We show that surprisingly,
              only a small fraction of frames exhibiting the strongest
              cofluctuation amplitude are required to explain a significant
              fraction of variance in the overall pattern of connection weights

              effect of Dominance for the impairment model (P = 0.01) but not

              temporarily altering subjective experience through their
              neurochemical effects. The RElaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics
              (REBUS) model postulates that 5-HT2a receptor agonism allows the
              brain to explore its dynamic landscape more readily, as suggested
              by more diverse (entropic) brain activity. Formally, this effect
              is theorized to correspond to a reduction in the energy required
              to transition between different brain-states, i.e. a ``flattening
              of the energy landscape.'' However, this hypothesis remains thus
              far untested. Here, we leverage network control theory to map the
              brain's energy landscape, by quantifying the energy required to
              transition between recurrent brain states. In accordance with the
              REBUS model, we show that LSD reduces the energy required for
              brain-state transitions, and, furthermore, that this reduction in
              energy correlates with more frequent state transitions and
              increased entropy of brain-state dynamics. Through network
              control analysis that incorporates the spatial distribution of
              5-HT2a receptors, we demonstrate the specific role of this
              receptor in flattening the brain's energy landscape. Also, in
              accordance with REBUS, we show that the occupancy of bottom-up
              states is increased by LSD. In addition to validating fundamental
              predictions of the REBUS model of psychedelic action, this work
              highlights the potential of receptor-informed network control
              theory to provide mechanistic insights into pharmacological
              modulation of brain dynamics. Significance Statement We present a
              multi-modal framework for quantifying the effects of a
              psychedelic drug (LSD) on brain dynamics by combining functional
              magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI), positron
              emission tomography (PET) and network control theory. Our
              findings provide support for a fundamental theory of the
              mechanism of action of psychedelics by showing that LSD flattens
              the brain's energy landscape, allowing for more facile and
              frequent state transitions and more temporally diverse brain
              activity. We also demonstrate that the spatial distribution of
              serotonin 2a receptors - the main target of LSD - is key for
              generating these effects. This approach could be used to

  abstract = "In studies of patients with focal brain lesions, it is often
              useful to coregister an image of the patient's brain to that of
              another subject or a standard template. We refer to this process
              as spatial normalization. Spatial normalization can improve the
              presentation and analysis of lesion location in
              neuropsychological studies; it can also allow other data, for
              example from functional imaging, to be compared to data from
              other patients or normal controls. In functional imaging, the
              standard procedure for spatial normalization is to use an
              automated algorithm, which minimizes a measure of difference
              between image and template, based on image intensity values.
              These algorithms usually optimize both linear (translations,
              rotations, zooms, and shears) and nonlinear transforms. In the
              presence of a focal lesion, automated algorithms attempt to
              reduce image mismatch between template and image at the site of
              the lesion. This can lead to significant inappropriate image
              distortion, especially when nonlinear transforms are used. One
              solution is to use cost-function masking-masking the areas used
              in the calculation of image difference-to exclude the area of the
              lesion, so that the lesion does not bias the transformations. We
              introduce and evaluate this technique using normalizations of a
              selection of brains with focal lesions and normal brains with
              simulated lesions. Our results suggest that cost-function masking
              is superior to the standard approach to this problem, which is
              affine-only normalization; we propose that cost-function masking
              should be used routinely for normalizations of brains with focal
              lesions.",

              cohort 1 (R(2) = 0.69 vs. R(2) = 0.67; p = 0.43) and cohort 2
              (R(2) = 0.69 vs. R(2) = 0.62; p = 0.25). In the severely impaired
              subgroup (defined as UE-FM $\leq$ 10 at baseline), wCST-LL
              correlated with outcomes significantly better than clinical
              assessment (R(2) = 0.47 vs. R(2) = 0.11; p = 0.03). In the
              nonseverely impaired subgroup, stroke patients recovered
              approximately 70\% of their maximal recovery potential. All
              stroke patients in both cohorts had poor motor outcomes at 3
              months (defined as UE-FM $\leq$ 25) when wCST-LL was $\geq$ 7.0

              wCST-LL, an imaging biomarker determined in the acute phase, can
              predict poststroke motor outcomes at 3 months, especially in
              patients with severe impairment at baseline.",

              (fMRI) has been used to examine the brain mechanisms of stroke
              patients with hemiplegia, but the relationship between functional
              connectivity (FC) and treatment-induced motor function recovery
              has not yet been fully investigated. This study aimed to identify
              the brain FC changes in stroke patients and study the
              relationship between FC and motor function assessment using the
              resting-state fMRI. METHODS: Seventeen stroke patients with
              hemiplegia and fifteen healthy control subjects (HCSs) were
              recruited in this study. We compared the FC between the
              ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) and the whole brain of the
              patients with the FC of the HCSs and studied the FC changes in
              the patients before and after conventional rehabilitation and
              motor imagery therapy. Additionally, correlations between the FC
              change and motor function of the patients were studied. RESULTS:
              Compared to the HCSs, the FC in the patient group was
              significantly increased between the ipsilesional M1 and the
              ipsilesional inferior parietal cortex, frontal gyrus,
              supplementary motor area (SMA), and contralesional angular and
              decreased between the ipsilesional M1 and bilateral M1. After the
              treatment, the FC between the ipsilesional M1 and contralesional
              M1 increased while the FC between the ipsilesional M1 and
              ipsilesional SMA and paracentral lobule decreased. A
              statistically significant correlation was found between the FC
              change in the bilateral M1 and the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA)

              populations are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity,
              as measured using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent
              across 2 populations, those populations are said to be
              functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously
              been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity
              patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we
              investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether
              systems-level properties of functional networks--including their
              spatial statistics and their persistence across time--can be
              accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network.
              We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI)
              and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging
              tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution.
              Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model
              of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we
              observed (i) that strong functional connections commonly exist
              between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering
              the inference of structural connectivity from functional
              connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and
              interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in
              functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural
              connectivity; and (iii) that resting-state functional
              connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning

              demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity

              direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial

              dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs
              in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then
              encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to
              automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the
              intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we
              used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new
              method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of
              mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When
              compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly
              accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs,

              corticospinal tract (CST) also receives fibers from dorsal and
              ventral premotor cortices and supplementary motor area, all of
              which might potentially contribute to motor function after
              stroke. We sought to quantify the microstructural integrity of
              CST originating from the hand representations in these 4 motor
              cortices separately and examined how these values related to hand
              motor impairment. METHODS: Probabilistic tractography from
              functional MRI-defined cortical sites demonstrated continuous CST
              originating from hand representations within each motor area in a
              group of healthy subjects. Microstructural integrity for each
              tract was calculated using fractional anisotropy at the level of
              the posterior limb of the internal capsule in a group of patients
              with chronic stroke. RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy was reduced
              in all 4 CSTs in the affected hemisphere. Grip strength
              correlated with the integrity of the CSTs originating from
              primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices, whereas, in a
              multiple regression model, the latter improved the ability of
              primary motor cortex CST to explain variability in grip strength.
              CONCLUSION: Handgrip critically depends on the CST originating in
              primary motor cortex but microstructural integrity of CST
              originating from premotor cortices appears to play a role in
              supporting motor function after stroke.",

              consensus among the neurorehabilitation community about which
              biomarker(s) have the highest predictive value for motor
              recovery. Objective To review the evidence and determine which
              neurological biomarker(s) meet the high evidence quality criteria
              for use in predicting motor recovery. Methods We searched
              databases for prognostic neuroimaging/neurophysiological studies.
              Methodological quality of each study was assessed using a
              previously employed comprehensive 15-item rating system.
              Furthermore, we used the GRADE approach and ranked the overall
              evidence quality for each category of neurologic biomarker.
              Results Seventy-one articles met our inclusion criteria; 5
              categories of neurologic biomarkers were identified: diffusion
              tensor imaging (DTI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),
              functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), conventional
              structural MRI (sMRI), and a combination of these biomarkers.
              Most studies were conducted with individuals after ischemic
              stroke in the acute and/or subacute stage (~70\%). Less than
              one-third of the studies (21/71) were assessed with satisfactory
              methodological quality (80\% or more of total quality score).
              Conventional structural MRI and the combination biomarker
              categories ranked ``high'' in overall evidence quality.
              Conclusions There were 3 prevalent methodological limitations:
              (a) lack of cross-validation, (b) lack of minimal clinically
              important difference (MCID) for motor outcomes, and (c) small

              integrity of the motor system, whereas the left-to-right motor

              subcortical stroke on the interaction of cortical motor areas
              within and across hemispheres during the generation of voluntary
              hand movements. METHODS: Twelve subacute stroke patients with a
              subcortical ischemic lesion and 12 age-matched control subjects
              were scanned using 3-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging.
              Subjects performed visually paced hand movements with their left,
              right, or both hands. Changes of effective connectivity among a
              bilateral network of core motor regions comprising M1, lateral
              premotor cortex, and the supplementary motor area (SMA) were
              assessed using dynamic causal modeling. RESULTS: The data showed
              significant disturbances in the effective connectivity of motor
              areas in the patients group: Independently from hand movements,
              the intrinsic neural coupling between ipsilesional SMA and M1,
              and the interhemispheric coupling of both SMAs was significantly
              reduced. Furthermore, movements of the stroke-affected hand
              showed additional inhibitory influences from contralesional to
              ipsilesional M1 that correlated with the degree of motor
              impairment. For bimanual movements, interhemispheric
              communication between ipsilesional SMA and contralesional M1 was
              significantly reduced, which also correlated with impaired
              bimanual performance. INTERPRETATION: The motor deficit of
              patients with a single subcortical lesion is associated with
              pathological interhemispheric interactions among key motor areas.
              The data suggest that a dysfunction between ipsilesional and
              contralesional M1, and between ipsilesional SMA and
              contralesional M1 underlies hand motor disability after stroke.
              Assessing effective connectivity by means of functional magnetic
              resonance imaging and dynamic causal modeling might be used in

  abstract = "Background and Purpose Up to two-thirds of stroke survivors
              experience persistent sensorimotor impairments. Recovery relies
              on the integrity of spared brain areas to compensate for damaged
              tissue. Subcortical regions play critical roles in the control
              and regulation of sensorimotor circuits. The goal of this work is
              to identify associations between volumes of spared subcortical
              nuclei and sensorimotor behavior at different timepoints after
              stroke. Methods We pooled high-resolution T1-weighted MRI brain
              scans and behavioral data in 828 individuals with unilateral
              stroke from 28 cohorts worldwide. Cross-sectional analyses using
              linear mixed-effects models related post-stroke sensorimotor
              behavior to non-lesioned subcortical volumes
              (Bonferroni-corrected, p<0.004). We tested subacute ($\leq$90
              days) and chronic ($\geq$180 days) stroke subgroups separately,
              with exploratory analyses in early stroke ($\leq$21 days) and
              across all time. Sub-analyses in chronic stroke were also
              performed based on class of sensorimotor deficits (impairment,
              activity limitations) and side of lesioned hemisphere. Results
              Worse sensorimotor behavior was associated with a smaller
              ipsilesional thalamic volume in both early (n=179; d =0.68) and
              subacute (n=274, d =0.46) stroke. In chronic stroke (n=404),
              worse sensorimotor behavior was associated with smaller
              ipsilesional putamen ( d =0.52) and nucleus accumbens ( d =0.39)
              volumes, and a larger ipsilesional lateral ventricle ( d =-0.42).
              Worse chronic sensorimotor impairment specifically (measured by
              the Fugl-Meyer Assessment; n=256) was associated with smaller
              ipsilesional putamen ( d =0.72) and larger lateral ventricle ( d
              =-0.41) volumes, while several measures of activity limitations
              (n=116) showed no significant relationships. In the full cohort
              across all time (n=828), sensorimotor behavior was associated
              with the volumes of the ipsilesional nucleus accumbens ( d
              =0.23), putamen ( d =0.33), thalamus ( d =0.33), and lateral
              ventricle ( d =-0.23). Conclusions We demonstrate significant
              relationships between post-stroke sensorimotor behavior and
              reduced volumes of subcortical gray matter structures that were
              spared by stroke, which differ by time and class of sensorimotor
              measure. These findings may provide additional targets for
              improving post-stroke sensorimotor outcomes. \#\#\# Competing

              large (N = 116) sample of participants who were in the chronic
              stages of stroke, we present a systematic study of the
              association between brain damage and functional connectivity
              within the intact hemisphere. We computed correlations between
              regional cortical damage and contralateral functional

              had the most pronounced effect on the right-hemisphere functional
              connectivity, and, conversely, right-hemisphere connections where
              the effect of damage was particularly strong. Notably, the vast

  abstract = "Identification of optimal treatment strategies to improve
              recovery is limited by the incomplete understanding of the
              neurobiological principles of recovery. Motor cortex (M1)
              reorganization of the lesioned hemisphere (ipsilesional M1) plays
              a major role in post-stroke motor recovery and is a primary
              target for rehabilitation therapy. Reorganization of M1 in the
              hemisphere contralateral to the stroke (contralesional M1) may,
              however, serve as an additional source of cortical reorganization
              and related recovery. The extent and outcome of such
              reorganization depends on many factors, including lesion size and
              time since stroke. In the chronic phase post-stroke,
              contralesional M1 seems to interfere with motor function of the
              paretic limb in a subset of patients, possibly through abnormally
              increased inhibition of lesioned M1 by the contralesional M1. In
              such patients, decreasing contralesional M1 excitability by
              cortical stimulation results in improved performance of the
              paretic limb. However, emerging evidence suggests a potentially
              supportive role of contralesional M1. After infarction of M1 or
              its corticospinal projections, there is abnormally increased
              excitatory neural activity and activation in contralesional M1
              that correlates with favorable motor recovery. Decreasing
              contralesional M1 excitability in these patients may result in
              deterioration of paretic limb performance. In animal stroke
              models, reorganizational changes in contralesional M1 depend on
              the lesion size and rehabilitation treatment and include
              long-term changes in neurotransmitter systems, dendritic growth,
              and synapse formation. While there is, therefore, some evidence
              that activity in contralesional M1 will impact the extent of
              motor function of the paretic limb in the subacute and chronic
              phase post-stroke and may serve as a new target for
              rehabilitation treatment strategies, the precise factors that
              specifically influence its role in the recovery process remain to
              be defined.",

              multimodal approach to a group of well-recovered chronic stroke
              patients (n = 11; aged 50-81 years) with left capsular lesions.
              Focal activation during recovered hand movements was assessed
              with EEG spectral analysis and H2(15)O-PET with EMG monitoring,
              cortico-cortical connectivity with EEG coherence analysis
              (cortico-cortical coherence) and corticospinal connectivity with
              transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). As seen from comparisons
              with age-matched controls, our patients showed enhanced
              recruitment of the lateral premotor cortex of the lesioned
              hemisphere [Brodmann area (BA) 6], lateral premotor and to a
              lesser extent primary sensorimotor and parietal cortex of the
              contralesional hemisphere (CON-H; BA 4 and superior parietal
              lobule) and left cerebellum (patients versus controls, Z > 3.09).
              EEG coherence analysis showed that after stroke cortico-cortical
              connections were reduced in the stroke hemisphere but relatively
              increased in the CON-H (ANOVA, contrast analysis, P < 0.05),
              suggesting a shift of functional connectivity towards the CON-H.
              Nevertheless, fast conducting corticospinal transmission
              originated exclusively from the lesioned hemisphere. No direct
              ipsilateral motor evoked potentials (MEPs) could be elicited with
              TMS over the contralesional primary motor cortex (iM1) in stroke
              patients. We conclude that (i) effective recovery is based on
              enhanced utilization of ipsi- and contralesional resources, (ii)
              basic corticospinal commands arise from the lesioned hemisphere
              without recruitment of ('latent') uncrossed corticospinal tract
              fibres and (iii) increased contralesional activity probably
              facilitates control of recovered motor function by operating at a
              higher-order processing level, similar to but not identical with

              In the proposed method, significant principal components are
              derived from noise regions-of-interest (ROI) in which the time
              series data are unlikely to be modulated by neural activity.
              These components are then included as nuisance parameters within

              series data. Two approaches for the determination of the noise

              of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, while the second method
              defines a region based upon the temporal standard deviation of

              utility of functional MRI has recently received increased
              attention. Such analyses require first and foremost a reasonable
              definition of a set of nodes as input to the network analysis. To
              date many applications have used existing atlases based on
              cytoarchitecture, task-based fMRI activations, or anatomic
              delineations. A potential pitfall in using such atlases is that

              steroid hormones influence the central nervous system across
              multiple spatiotemporal scales. Estrogen and progesterone
              concentrations rise and fall throughout the menstrual cycle, but

              hormones shape human brain dynamics. Here, we assessed the
              structure and stability of resting-state brain network activity
              in concordance with serum hormone levels from a female who
              underwent fMRI and venipuncture for 30 consecutive days. Our
              results reveal that while network structure is largely stable

              neural resources rather than stroke-induced neural

              compared to healthy subjects. Accordingly, eleven well-recovered
              left-hemispheric chronic stroke patients were scanned using

              assessed for fist closures at increasing movement frequencies

  abstract = "Stroke causes a sudden disruption of physiological brain function
              which leads to impairments of functional brain networks involved
              in voluntary movements. In some cases, the brain has the
              intrinsic capacity to reorganize itself, thereby compensating for
              the disruption of motor networks. In humans, such reorganization
              can be investigated in vivo using neuroimaging. Recent
              developments in connectivity analyses based on functional
              neuroimaging data have provided new insights into the network
              pathophysiology underlying neurological symptoms. Here we review
              recent neuroimaging studies using functional resting-state
              correlations, effective connectivity models or graph theoretical
              analyses to investigate changes in neural motor networks and
              recovery after stroke. The data demonstrate that network
              disturbances after stroke occur not only in the vicinity of the
              lesion but also between remote cortical areas in the affected and
              unaffected hemisphere. The reorganization of motor networks
              encompasses a restoration of interhemispheric functional
              coherence in the resting state, particularly between the primary
              motor cortices. Furthermore, reorganized neural networks feature
              strong excitatory interactions between fronto-parietal areas and
              primary motor cortex in the affected hemisphere, suggesting that
              greater top-down control over primary motor areas facilitates
              motor execution in the lesioned brain. In addition, there is
              evidence that motor recovery is accompanied by a more random
              network topology with reduced local information processing. In
              conclusion, Stroke induces changes in functional and effective
              connectivity within and across hemispheres which relate to motor
              impairments and recovery thereof. Connectivity analyses may hence
              provide new insights into the pathophysiology underlying

              connectivity (rsFC) between homotopic, motor-related brain
              regions is associated with upper-extremity control early after
              stroke. OBJECTIVES: This study examined various patterns of rsFC
              in chronic stroke, a time at which extensive neural
              reorganization has occurred. Associations between homotopic
              somatomotor connectivity and clinical measures, representing
              separate domains of upper-extremity function, were determined.
              METHODS: A total of 19 persons $\geq$6 months poststroke
              participated. Four connectivity patterns within a somatomotor
              network were quantified using functional magnetic resonance
              imaging. Upper-extremity gross muscle activation, control, and
              real-world use were evaluated with the Motricity Index, Action
              Research Arm Test, and accelerometry, respectively. RESULTS:
              Connectivity between homotopic regions was stronger than that in
              the contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres. No differences
              in connectivity strength were noted between homotopic pairs,
              indicating that a specific brain structure was not driving
              somatomotor network connectivity. Homotopic connectivity was
              significantly associated with both upper-extremity control (r =
              0.53; P= .02) and real-world use (r = 0.54; P= .02); however,
              there was no association with gross muscle activation (r = 0.23;
              P=.34). The combination of clinical measures accounted for 40\%
              of the variance in rsFC (= .05). CONCLUSIONS: The results
              reported here expand on previous findings, indicating that
              homotopic rsFC persists in chronic stroke and discriminates
              between varying levels of upper-extremity control and real-world
              use. Further work is needed to evaluate its adequacy as a

              dysfunction may contribute significantly to behavioral deficits

              significance of changes in the coherence of spontaneous activity
              in distributed networks after stroke by measuring resting state
              functional connectivity (FC) using functional magnetic resonance
              imaging. METHODS: In acute stroke patients, we measured FC in a
              dorsal attention network and an arm somatomotor network, and
              determined the correlation of FC with performance obtained in a
              separate session on tests of attention and motor function. In
              particular, we compared the behavioral correlation with
              intrahemispheric FC to the behavioral correlation with
              interhemispheric FC. RESULTS: In the attention network,
              disruption of interhemispheric FC was significantly correlated
              with abnormal detection of visual stimuli (Pearson r with field
              effect = -0.624, p = 0.002). In the somatomotor network,
              disruption of interhemispheric FC was significantly correlated
              with upper extremity impairment (Pearson r with contralesional
              Action Research Arm Test = 0.527, p = 0.036). In contrast,
              intrahemispheric FC within the normal or damaged hemispheres was
              not correlated with performance in either network. Quantitative
              lesion analysis demonstrated that our results could not be
              explained by structural damage alone. INTERPRETATION: These
              results suggest that lesions cause state changes in the
              spontaneous functional architecture of the brain, and constrain
              behavioral output. Clinically, these results validate using FC
              for assessing the health of brain networks, with implications for
              prognosis and recovery from stroke, and underscore the importance

  author   = "Carrera, Emmanuel and Tononi, Giulio",
  abstract = "After a century of false hopes, recent studies have placed the
              concept of diaschisis at the centre of the understanding of brain
              function. Originally, the term 'diaschisis' was coined by von
              Monakow in 1914 to describe the neurophysiological changes that
              occur distant to a focal brain lesion. In the following decades,
              this concept triggered widespread clinical interest in an attempt
              to describe symptoms and signs that the lesion could not fully
              explain. However, the first imaging studies, in the late 1970s,
              only partially confirmed the clinical significance of diaschisis.
              Focal cortical areas of diaschisis (i.e. focal diaschisis)
              contributed to the clinical deficits after subcortical but only
              rarely after cortical lesions. For this reason, the concept of
              diaschisis progressively disappeared from the mainstream of
              research in clinical neurosciences. Recent evidence has
              unexpectedly revitalized the notion. The development of new
              imaging techniques allows a better understanding of the
              complexity of brain organization. It is now possible to reliably
              investigate a new type of diaschisis defined as the changes of
              structural and functional connectivity between brain areas
              distant to the lesion (i.e. connectional diaschisis). As opposed
              to focal diaschisis, connectional diaschisis, focusing on
              determined networks, seems to relate more consistently to the
              clinical findings. This is particularly true after stroke in the
              motor and attentional networks. Furthermore, normalization of
              remote connectivity changes in these networks relates to a better
              recovery. In the future, to investigate the clinical role of
              diaschisis, a systematic approach has to be considered. First,
              emerging imaging and electrophysiological techniques should be
              used to precisely map and selectively model brain lesions in
              human and animals studies. Second, the concept of diaschisis must
              be applied to determine the impact of a focal lesion on new
              representations of the complexity of brain organization. As an
              example, the evaluation of remote changes in the structure of the
              connectome has so far mainly been tested by modelization of focal
              brain lesions. These changes could now be assessed in patients
              suffering from focal brain lesions (i.e. connectomal diaschisis).
              Finally, and of major significance, focal and non-focal
              neurophysiological changes distant to the lesion should be the
              target of therapeutic strategies. Neuromodulation using
              transcranial magnetic stimulation is one of the most promising
              techniques. It is when this last step will be successful that the
              concept of diaschisis will gain all the clinical respectability
              that could not be obtained in decades of research.",

              mechanisms underlying this recovery of function remain unclear.
              METHODS: Twenty well-recovered patients with acute pontine
              infarcts and 20 well-recovered patients with acute
              striato-capsular infarcts were recruited. Fugl-Meyer assessment

              assigned to better and worse recovery subgroups according to the
              degree of motor recovery at the twelfth week after stroke.
              Voxel-wise degree centrality (DC)-behavior correlation analysis
              was used to identify brain regions related to changes in motor
              function within 12 weeks after stroke. RESULTS: A significant

              that might help facilitate upper-limb motor recovery in stroke
              survivors with extensive CST damage. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of
              this study was to investigate resting state functional
              connectivity in chronic stroke survivors with different levels of
              CST damage and to explore neural correlates of greater upper-limb
              motor performance in stroke survivors with compromised
              ipsilesional CST integrity. METHODS: Thirty chronic stroke
              survivors (24 males, aged 64.7 $\pm$ 10.8 years) participated in
              this study. Three experimental sessions were conducted to: 1)
              obtain anatomical (T1, T2) structural (diffusion) and functional
              (resting state) MRI sequences, 2) determine CST integrity with
              transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and conduct assessments
              of upper-limb behavior, and 3) reconfirm CST integrity status.
              Participants were divided into groups according to the extent of
              CST damage. Those in the extensive CST damage group did not show
              TMS evoked responses and had significantly lower ipsilesional
              fractional anisotropy. RESULTS: Of the 30 chronic stroke
              survivors, 12 were categorized as having extensive CST damage.
              Stroke survivors with extensive CST damage had weaker functional
              connectivity in the ipsilesional sensorimotor network and greater
              functional connectivity in the ipsilesional fronto-parietal
              network compared to those with preserved CST integrity. For
              participants with extensive CST damage, improved motor
              performance was associated with greater functional connectivity
              of the ipsilesional fronto-parietal network and higher fractional
              anisotropy of the ipsilesional rostral superior longitudinal
              fasciculus. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke survivors with extensive CST
              damage have greater resting state functional connectivity of an
              ipsilesional fronto-parietal network that appears to be a
              behaviorally relevant neural mechanism that improves upper-limb
              motor performance.",

  abstract = "Measurement of stroke recovery is complex because definition of
              successful recovery is highly variable across measures and
              cut-off points for defining successful outcomes vary. The purpose
              of this paper is to describe patterns of recovery in stroke
              patients of varying severity when different measures are used and
              when different cut-off points are selected. 459 individuals
              enrolled in a prospective cohort study were assessed within 14
              days post stroke and re-evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months. Recovery
              was assessed using the NIH Stroke Scale, the Fugl-Meyer
              Assessment of Motor Recovery, the Barthel Index of Activities of
              Daily Living, the Physical Function Index of the SF-36, and the
              Modified Rankin Outcome Scale. Subjects also defined their
              preference (utility) for their current health state with a
              time-trade off question. We compared patterns of recovery using
              the different measures and varying the cut-off points for
              defining successful recovery. The percentage of patients who are
              believed to have recovered depends on how recovery is defined. If
              recovery is defined at the disability level (Barthel > 90), the
              majority 57.3\% of stroke survivors experience a full recovery.
              Fewer individuals are considered to be fully recovered if
              impairments are measured (NIH 90, 36.8\%. Less than 25\% of
              stroke survivors are considered recovered if recovery is defined
              relative to reported prior function in higher levels of physical
              activity. Shifting the definition of recovery on the modified
              Rankin scale from </= 1 to </= 2 shifts the percentage of those
              deemed recovered from </= 25\% to 53.8\%. In designing drug
              trials the methods for defining stroke recovery should be
              carefully considered. If recovery is defined in terms of
              disability, a higher proportion of the placebo group will achieve
              the outcome than if impairments are used to define recovery. The
              benchmarks for recovery in minor strokes must include measures of
              higher functioning (e.g. the SF-36 physical functioning index or
              a Rankin 0 (no symptoms).",

              underpinnings of motor and cognitive recovery by longitudinally
              studying the changes of CBF and FC in pontine infarction (PI).
              Twenty patients underwent three-dimensional pseudo-continuous
              arterial spin labeling (3D-pcASL), resting-state functional
              magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans, and behavioral

              normal control (NC) subjects underwent the same examination once.
              First, we investigated CBF changes in the acute stage, and
              longitudinal changes from 1 week to 6 months after PI. Brain
              regions with longitudinal CBF changes were then used as seeds to
              investigate longitudinal FC alterations during the follow-up
              period. Compared with NC, patients in the left PI (LPI) and right
              PI (RPI) groups showed significant CBF alterations in the
              bilateral cerebellum and some supratentorial brain regions at the

              values in the right supramarginal (SMG\_R) for the LPI group,
              while the RPI group showed significantly dynamic changes of CBF

              changes in the SMG\_R and FC values between the SMG\_R and MOG\_L
              were associated with motor and memory scores in the LPI group,
              and longitudinal CBF changes in the CAL\_L and SMA\_R were
              related to memory and motor recovery in the RPI group. These
              longitudinal CBF and accompany FC alterations may provide

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Functional MRI (fMRI) studies could
              provide crucial information on the neural mechanisms of motor
              recovery in patients with stroke. Resting-state fMRI is
              applicable to patients with stroke who are not capable of proper
              performance of the motor task. In this study, we explored neural
              correlates of motor recovery in patients with stroke by
              investigating longitudinal changes in resting-state functional
              connectivity of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1).
              METHODS: A longitudinal observational study using repeated fMRI
              experiments was conducted in 12 patients with stroke.
              Resting-state fMRI data were acquired 4 times over a period of 6
              months. Patients participated in the first session of fMRI
              shortly after onset and thereafter in subsequent sessions at 1,
              3, and 6 months after onset. Resting-state functional
              connectivity of the ipsilesional M1 was assessed and compared
              with that of healthy subjects. RESULTS: Compared with healthy
              subjects, patients demonstrated higher functional connectivity
              with the ipsilesional frontal and parietal cortices, bilateral
              thalamus, and cerebellum. Instead, functional connectivity with
              the contralesional M1 and occipital cortex were decreased in
              patients with stroke. Functional connectivity between the
              ipsilesional and contralesional M1 showed the most asymmetry at 1
              month after onset to the ipsilesional side. Functional
              connectivity of the ipsilesional M1 with the contralesional
              thalamus, supplementary motor area, and middle frontal gyrus at
              onset was positively correlated with motor recovery at 6 months
              after stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Resting-state fMRI elicited
              distinctive but comparable results with previous task-based fMRI,
              presenting complementary and practical values for use in the
              study of patients with stroke.",

              respond to a visual stimulus in the contralesional hemifield when
              presented simultaneously with an ipsilesional stimulus (Corbetta
              and Shulman, 2011). Unilateral damage to the macaque
              frontoparietal cortex commonly leads to deficits in
              contralesional target selection that resemble visual extinction.
              Recently, we showed that macaque monkeys with unilateral lesions
              in the caudal prefrontal cortex (PFC) exhibited contralesional
              target selection deficits that recovered over 2-4 months (Adam et
              al., 2019). Here, we investigated the longitudinal changes in
              functional connectivity (FC) of the frontoparietal network after
              a small or large right caudal PFC lesion in four macaque monkeys.
              We collected ultra-high field resting-state fMRI at 7-T before
              the lesion and at weeks 1-16 post-lesion and compared the
              functional data with behavioural performance on a free-choice
              saccade task. We found that the pattern of frontoparietal network
              FC changes depended on lesion size, such that the recovery of
              contralesional extinction was associated with an initial increase
              in network FC that returned to baseline in the two small lesion
              monkeys, whereas FC continued to increase throughout recovery in
              the two monkeys with a larger lesion. We also found that the FC
              between contralesional dorsolateral PFC and ipsilesional parietal
              cortex correlated with behavioural recovery and that the
              contralesional dorsolateral PFC showed increasing degree
              centrality with the frontoparietal network. These findings
              suggest that both the contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres
              play an important role in the recovery of function. Importantly,
              optimal compensation after large PFC lesions may require greater
              recruitment of distant and intact areas of the frontoparietal
              network, whereas recovery from smaller lesions was supported by a
              normalization of the functional network.",

              function after brain damage or stroke remains unresolved. Here we
              show that the ipsilesional ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and
              perilesional primary motor cortex (M1) of rhesus macaque monkeys
              are involved in the recovery of manual dexterity after a lesion
              of M1. A focal lesion of the hand digit area in M1 was made by
              means of ibotenic acid injection. This lesion initially caused
              flaccid paralysis in the contralateral hand but was followed by
              functional recovery of hand movements, including precision grip,
              during the course of daily postlesion motor training. Brain
              imaging of regional cerebral blood flow by means of H2
              (15)O-positron emission tomography revealed enhanced activity of
              the PMv during the early postrecovery period and increased
              functional connectivity within M1 during the late postrecovery
              period. The causal role of these areas in motor recovery was
              confirmed by means of pharmacological inactivation by muscimol
              during the different recovery periods. These findings indicate
              that, in both the remaining primary motor and premotor cortical
              areas, time-dependent plastic changes in neural activity and
              connectivity are involved in functional recovery from the motor
              deficit caused by the M1 lesion. Therefore, it is likely that the
              PMv, an area distant from the core of the lesion, plays an
              important role during the early postrecovery period, whereas the
              perilesional M1 contributes to functional recovery especially

              neglect due to acute, subcortical infarct can be accounted for by
              concurrent cortical hypoperfusion. To test this hypothesis, we
              demonstrate: (i) that pure subcortical infarctions are associated
              with cortical hypoperfusion in subjects with aphasia/neglect;
              (ii) that reversal of cortical hypoperfusion is associated with
              resolution of the aphasia; and (iii) that aphasia/neglect
              strongly predicts cortical ischaemia and/or hypoperfusion. We
              prospectively evaluated a consecutive series of 115 patients who
              presented within 24 h of onset or progression of stroke symptoms,
              with MRI sequences including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and
              perfusion weighted imaging (PWI), and detailed testing for
              aphasia or hemispatial neglect. The association between aphasia
              or neglect and cortical infarct (or dense ischaemia) on DWI and
              cortical hypoperfusion indicated by PWI, was evaluated with
              chi-squared analyses. Fisher exact tests were used for analyses

              white matter and/or grey matter structures (n = 44) were examined
              for the presence of aphasia or neglect, and for the presence of
              cortical hypoperfusion. In addition, subjects who received
              intervention to restore perfusion were evaluated with DWI, PWI,
              and cognitive tests before and after intervention. Finally, the
              positive predictive value of the cognitive deficits for
              identifying cortical abnormalities on DWI and PWI were calculated
              from all patients. Of the subjects with only subcortical lesions
              on DWI in this study (n = 44), all those who had aphasia or
              neglect showed concurrent cortical hypoperfusion. Among the
              patients who received intervention that successfully restored
              cortical perfusion, 100\% (six out of six) showed immediate
              resolution of aphasia. In the 115 patients, aphasia and neglect
              were much more strongly associated with cortical hypoperfusion
              (chi(2) = 57.3 for aphasia; chi(2) = 28.7 for neglect; d.f. = 1;
              P < 0.000001 for each), than with cortical infarct/ischaemia on

              1; P < 0.005 for each). Aphasia showed a much higher positive
              predictive value for cortical abnormality on PWI (95\%) than on
              DWI (62\%), as did neglect (100\% positive predictive value for
              PWI versus 74\% for DWI). From these data we conclude that

              between brain areas rather than their sole activity. For
              instance, category fluency requires the associations between
              executive, semantic, and language production functions. Findings:
              Here, we provide, for the first time, a set of complementary
              solutions for measuring the impact of a given lesion on the
              neuronal circuits. Our methods, which were applied to 37 patients
              with a focal frontal brain lesions, revealed a large set of
              directly and indirectly disconnected brain regions that had
              significantly impacted category fluency performance. The directly
              disconnected regions corresponded to areas that are classically
              considered as functionally engaged in verbal fluency and
              categorization tasks. These regions were also organized into
              larger directly and indirectly disconnected functional networks,
              including the left ventral fronto-parietal network, whose
              cortical thickness correlated with performance on category
              fluency. Conclusions: The combination of structural and
              functional connectivity together with cortical thickness
              estimates reveal the remote effects of brain lesions, provide for
              the identification of the affected networks, and strengthen our
              understanding of their relationship with cognitive and behavioral
              measures. The methods presented are available and freely

  abstract = "Our knowledge of the anatomical organization of the human brain
              in health and disease draws heavily on the study of patients with
              focal brain lesions. Historically the first method of mapping
              brain function, it is still potentially the most powerful,
              establishing the necessity of any putative neural substrate for a
              given function or deficit. Great inferential power, however,
              carries a crucial vulnerability: without stronger alternatives
              any consistent error cannot be easily detected. A hitherto
              unexamined source of such error is the structure of the
              high-dimensional distribution of patterns of focal damage,
              especially in ischaemic injury-the commonest aetiology in
              lesion-deficit studies-where the anatomy is naturally shaped by
              the architecture of the vascular tree. This distribution is so
              complex that analysis of lesion data sets of conventional size
              cannot illuminate its structure, leaving us in the dark about the
              presence or absence of such error. To examine this crucial
              question we assembled the largest known set of focal brain
              lesions (n = 581), derived from unselected patients with acute
              ischaemic injury (mean age = 62.3 years, standard deviation =
              17.8, male:female ratio = 0.547), visualized with
              diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and processed with
              validated automated lesion segmentation routines.
              High-dimensional analysis of this data revealed a hidden bias
              within the multivariate patterns of damage that will consistently
              distort lesion-deficit maps, displacing inferred critical regions
              from their true locations, in a manner opaque to replication.
              Quantifying the size of this mislocalization demonstrates that
              past lesion-deficit relationships estimated with conventional
              inferential methodology are likely to be significantly displaced,
              by a magnitude dependent on the unknown underlying lesion-deficit
              relationship itself. Past studies therefore cannot be
              retrospectively corrected, except by new knowledge that would
              render them redundant. Positively, we show that novel machine
              learning techniques employing high-dimensional inference can
              nonetheless accurately converge on the true locus. We conclude
              that current inferences about human brain function and deficits
              based on lesion mapping must be re-evaluated with methodology
              that adequately captures the high-dimensional structure of lesion
              data.",

              the adult cortex, whether these same rules hold after
              stroke-induced damage is unclear. After stroke, sensory
              representations damaged by stroke remap onto nearby surviving
              neurons. Here, we review the process of sensory remapping after
              stroke at multiple levels ranging from the initial damage to
              synapses, to their rewiring and function in intact sensory
              circuits. We introduce a new approach using in vivo 2-photon
              calcium imaging to determine how the response properties of
              individual somatosensory cortex neurons are altered during
              remapping. One month after forelimb-area stroke, normally highly
              limb-selective neurons in surviving peri-infarct areas exhibit
              remarkable flexibility and begin to process sensory stimuli from

              neurons within remapped regions develop a stronger response
              preference. Thus, remapping is initiated by surviving neurons
              adopting new roles in addition to their usual function. Later in
              recovery, these remapped forelimb-responsive neurons become more
              selective, but their new topographical representation may
              encroach on map territories of neurons that process sensory
              stimuli from other body parts. Neurons responding to multiple

              prescribing appropriate therapeutic strategies. Machine learning
              is a highly promising avenue with which to improve prediction
              accuracy in clinical practice. Objectives. The objective was to
              evaluate the performance of 5 machine learning methods in
              predicting postintervention upper-extremity motor impairment in
              chronic stroke patients using demographic, clinical,
              neurophysiological, and imaging input variables. Methods. A total
              of 102 patients (female: 31\%, age 61 $\pm$ 11 years) were
              included. The upper-extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UE-FMA) was
              used to assess motor impairment of the upper limb before and
              after intervention. Elastic net (EN), support vector machines,
              artificial neural networks, classification and regression trees,
              and random forest were used to predict postintervention UE-FMA.
              The performances of methods were compared using cross-validated
              R2. Results. EN performed significantly better than other methods
              in predicting postintervention UE-FMA using demographic and
              baseline clinical data (median R EN 2 = 0 . 91 , R RF 2 = 0 . 88

              threshold (MT) between the affected and unaffected hemispheres
              were the strongest predictors. The difference in MT had greater
              importance than the absence or presence of a motor-evoked

              learning methods may enable clinicians to accurately predict a
              chronic stroke patient's postintervention UE-FMA.
              Interhemispheric difference in the MT is an important predictor

              motor/hindlimb areas (<100 ms). One week after forelimb cortex

              depolarizations reemerged with a characteristic pattern in which
              responses began within surviving portions of forelimb cortex (<20

              neighboring peri-infarct motor/hindlimb areas in which

               we measured functional connectivity by using correlation and
               partial correlation between 114 cortical ROIs. We found
               fMRI-BOLD partial correlation was altered at more edges as a
               function of the structural connectome (SC) damage, relative to

              integrity in connecting fiber tracts. METHODS: Thirty-two
              patients (mean age 71 years) underwent a standardized protocol
              including multimodal MRI and clinical assessment both at stroke
              onset and 6 months after the event. Cortex connected to acute
              infarcts was identified by probabilistic diffusion tensor
              tractography starting from the acute lesion. Changes of cortical
              thickness were measured using the longitudinal stream of
              FreeSurfer. Microstructural damage in white matter tracts was
              assessed by changes of mean diffusivity. RESULTS: We found focal
              cortical thinning specifically in areas connected to acute
              infarcts (p < 0.001). Thinning was more pronounced in regions
              showing a high probability of connectivity to infarcts.
              Microstructural damage in white matter tracts connecting acute
              infarcts with distant cortex significantly correlated with
              thickness changes in that region ($\rho$ = -0.39, p = 0.028).

              infarct size, infarct location, and integrity of motor tracts. To
              determine the value of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as a
              predictor of motor outcome and its role as a structural surrogate
              marker of impairment in chronic stroke, we tested correlations
              between motor impairment and DTI-derived measures of motor tract
              integrity. METHODS: Thirty-five chronic stroke patients with
              varying degrees of recovery underwent DTI and motor impairment
              assessments. Fibers originating from the precentral gyrus were
              traced and separated into pyramidal tract (PT) and alternate
              motor fibers (aMF). Asymmetry indices of fiber number and
              regional fractional anisotropy (FA) values comparing lesional
              with nonlesional hemispheres were correlated with motor
              impairment scores and compared to an age-matched control group.
              RESULTS: Fiber number and regional FA value asymmetry
              significantly differed between the groups with lower values in
              the patients' lesional hemispheres. Both measures significantly
              predicted motor impairment with stronger predictions when all
              motor tracts were combined as compared to predictions using only
              the PT. The pattern of motor tract damage (PT only vs PT and aMF)
              led to a classification of mild, moderate, or severe impairment
              with significant between-group differences in motor impairment
              scores. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging-derived measures
              are valid structural markers of motor impairment. The integrity
              of all descending motor tracts, not merely the pyramidal tract,
              appears to account for stroke recovery. A 3-tier, hierarchical
              classification of impairment categories based on the pattern of
              motor tract damage is proposed that might be helpful in
              predicting recovery potential.",

  abstract = "The brainstem is a critical structure that regulates vital
              autonomic functions, houses the cranial nerves and their nuclei,
              relays motor and sensory information between the brain and spinal
              cord, and modulates cognition, mood, and emotions. As a primary
              relay center, the fiber pathways of the brainstem include
              efferent and afferent connections among the cerebral cortex,
              spinal cord, and cerebellum. While diffusion MRI has been
              successfully applied to map various brain pathways, its
              application for the in vivo imaging of the brainstem pathways has
              been limited due to inadequate resolution and large
              susceptibility-induced distortion artifacts. With the release of
              high-resolution data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP),
              there is increasing interest in mapping human brainstem pathways.
              Previous works relying on HCP data to study brainstem pathways,
              however, did not consider the prevalence (>80\%) of large
              distortions in the brainstem even after the application of
              correction procedures from the HCP-Pipeline. They were also
              limited in the lack of adequate consideration of subject
              variability in either fiber pathways or region of interests
              (ROIs) used for bundle reconstruction. To overcome these
              limitations, we develop in this work a probabilistic atlas of 23
              major brainstem bundles using high-quality HCP data passing
              rigorous quality control. For the large-scale data from the
              500-Subject release of HCP, we conducted extensive quality
              controls to exclude subjects with severe distortions in the
              brainstem area. After that, we developed a systematic protocol to
              manually delineate 1300 ROIs on 20 HCP subjects (10 males; 10
              females) for the reconstruction of fiber bundles using
              tractography techniques. Finally, we leveraged our novel
              connectome modeling techniques including high order fiber
              orientation distribution (FOD) reconstruction from multi-shell
              diffusion imaging and topography-preserving tract filtering
              algorithms to successfully reconstruct the 23 fiber bundles for
              each subject, which were then used to calculate the probabilistic
              atlases in the MNI152 space for public release. In our
              experimental results, we demonstrate that our method yielded
              anatomically faithful reconstruction of the brainstem pathways
              and achieved improved performance in comparison with an existing
              atlas of cerebellar peduncles based on HCP data. These atlases

              injury, measured from neuroimaging acquired during the acute
              stroke workup, predicts upper extremity motor recovery. Methods-
              Patients with upper extremity weakness after ischemic stroke were
              assessed using the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer during the acute
              stroke hospitalization and again at 3-month follow-up. CST injury
              was quantified and compared, using 4 different methods, from
              images obtained as part of the stroke standard-of-care workup.
              Logistic and linear regression were performed using CST injury to
              predict $\Delta$Fugl-Meyer. Injury to primary motor and premotor
              cortices were included as potential modifiers of the effect of
              CST injury on recovery. Results- N=48 patients were enrolled
              4.2$\pm$2.7 days poststroke and completed 3-month follow-up
              (median 90-day modified Rankin Scale score, 3; interquartile
              range, 1.5). CST injury distinguished patients who reached their
              recovery potential (as predicted from initial impairment) from
              those who did not, with area under the curve values ranging from
              0.70 to 0.8. In addition, CST injury explained $\approx$20\% of
              the variance in the magnitude of upper extremity recovery, even
              after controlling for the severity of initial impairment. Results
              were consistent when comparing 4 different methods of measuring
              CST injury. Extent of injury to primary motor and premotor
              cortices did not significantly influence the predictive value
              that CST injury had for recovery. Conclusions- Structural injury
              to the CST, as estimated from standard-of-care imaging available
              during the acute stroke hospitalization, is a robust way to
              distinguish patients who achieve their predicted recovery
              potential and explains a significant amount of the variance in

              impairment after a stroke relates to lesion size and location,
              but unexplained variability in recovery still exists. In this
              study, we used lesion-mapping techniques in combination with
              diffusion tensor imaging to quantitatively test the hypothesis
              that motor recovery in patients with chronic stroke is inversely
              related to the proportion of the corticospinal tract (CST)
              affected by the lesion. METHODS: We studied 50 patients with
              chronic stroke, all of whom presented with moderate to severe
              motor impairments in the acute stage, using high-resolution
              anatomic MRI. We evaluated the degree of motor impairment with
              the Upper Extremity module of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment. To
              analyze the relationship between CST damage and impairment
              scores, we calculated a CST-lesion load for each patient by
              overlaying the patient's lesion map with a probabilistic tract
              derived from diffusion tensor images of age-matched healthy
              subjects. RESULTS: CST-lesion load was a significant predictor of
              motor deficit. Infarct size, despite correlating with motor
              scores, did not significantly predict impairment. CONCLUSIONS:
              Our results show the degree of functional motor deficit after a
              stroke is highly dependent on the overlap of the lesion with the
              CST and not lesion size per se. In the future, automated
              calculation of CST-lesion load may allow more precise prediction

              where complex behavior manifests as a result of communication
              between large-scale functional systems such as visual and default
              mode networks. As the communication between brain regions occurs
              through underlying anatomical pathways, it is important to define
              a ``traffic pattern'' that properly describes how the regions
              exchange information. Empirically, the choice of the traffic
              pattern can be made based on how well the functional connectivity
              between regions matches the structural pathways equipped with
              that traffic pattern. In this paper, we present a multimodal
              connectomics paradigm utilizing graph matching to measure
              similarity between structural and functional connectomes (derived
              from dMRI and fMRI data) at node, system, and connectome level.
              Through an investigation of the brain's structure-function
              relationship over a large cohort of 641 healthy developmental
              participants aged 8-22 years, we demonstrate that communicability
              as the traffic pattern describes the functional connectivity of
              the brain best, with large-scale systems having significant
              agreement between their structural and functional connectivity
              patterns. Notably, matching between structural and functional
              connectivity for the functionally specialized modular systems
              such as visual and motor networks are higher as compared to other
              more integrated systems. Additionally, we show that the negative
              functional connectivity between the default mode network (DMN)

              significantly associated with its underlying structural
              connectivity, highlighting the counterbalance between functional
              activation patterns of DMN and other systems. Finally, we
              investigated sex difference and developmental changes in brain

              FC disruptions reflect damage to specific cortical regions.
              However, an alternative explanation is that they reflect the
              structural disconnection (SDC) of white matter pathways. Here, we
              compare these explanations using data from 114 stroke patients.
              Across multiple analyses, we find that SDC measures outperform

              widespread FC disruptions across patients and that correlates

              stroke-induced changes in network connectivity aggregated over
              the duration of several minutes. In this study, we used dynamic
              resting state functional MRI analyses to increase temporal
              resolution to seconds and explore transient configurations of
              motor network connectivity in acute stroke. To this end, we
              collected resting state functional MRI data of 31 patients with
              acute ischaemic stroke and 17 age-matched healthy control
              subjects. Stroke patients presented with moderate to severe hand
              motor deficits. By estimating dynamic functional connectivity
              within a sliding window framework, we identified three distinct
              connectivity configurations of motor-related networks. Motor
              networks were organized into three regional domains, i.e. a
              cortical, subcortical and cerebellar domain. The dynamic
              connectivity patterns of stroke patients diverged from those of
              healthy controls depending on the severity of the initial motor
              impairment. Moderately affected patients (n = 18) spent
              significantly more time in a weakly connected configuration that
              was characterized by low levels of connectivity, both locally as
              well as between distant regions. In contrast, severely affected
              patients (n = 13) showed a significant preference for transitions
              into a spatially segregated connectivity configuration. This
              configuration featured particularly high levels of local
              connectivity within the three regional domains as well as
              anti-correlated connectivity between distant networks across
              domains. A third connectivity configuration represented an
              intermediate connectivity pattern compared to the preceding two,
              and predominantly encompassed decreased interhemispheric
              connectivity between cortical motor networks independent of
              individual deficit severity. Alterations within this third
              configuration thus closely resembled previously reported ones
              originating from static resting state functional MRI studies
              post-stroke. In summary, acute ischaemic stroke not only prompted
              changes in connectivity between distinct networks, but it also
              caused characteristic changes in temporal properties of
              large-scale network interactions depending on the severity of the
              individual deficit. These findings offer new vistas on the

                 to five days after symptom onset. Re-occurring dynamic
                 connectivity configurations were obtained using a sliding

                 differences in dynamic patterns between three NIHSS-stroke
                 severity defined groups (mildly, moderately, and severely
                 affected patients). Furthermore, we established correlation
                 analyses between dynamic connectivity estimates and AIS
                 severity as well as neurological recovery within the first 90
                 days after stroke. Finally, we built Bayesian hierarchical
                 models to predict acute ischemic stroke severity and examine
                 the inter-relation of dynamic connectivity and clinical
                 measures, with an emphasis on white matter hyperintensity

                 connectivity configurations in the early post-acute stroke
                 phase. More severely affected patients (NIHSS 10-21) spent
                 significantly more time in a highly segregated dynamic
                 connectivity configuration that was characterized by
                 particularly strong connectivity (three-level ANOVA: p<0.05,
                 post hoc t-tests: p<0.05, FDR-corrected for multiple
                 comparisons). Recovery, as indexed by the realized change of
                 the NIHSS over time, was significantly linked to the acute
                 dynamic connectivity between bilateral intraparietal lobule
                 and left angular gyrus (Pearson's r=-0.68, p<0.05,
                 FDR-corrected). Increasing dwell times, particularly those in
                 a very segregated connectivity configuration, predicted higher
                 acute stroke severity in our Bayesian modelling framework.

              methods allow for the estimation of structural and functional
              disconnection from clinical structural imaging. This is achieved
              by embedding a patient's lesion into an atlas of functional and
              structural connections in healthy subjects, and deriving the
              ensemble of structural and functional connections that pass
              through the lesion, thus indirectly estimating its impact on the
              whole brain connectome. This indirect assessment of network
              dysfunction is more readily available than direct measures of
              functional and structural connectivity obtained with functional
              and diffusion MRI, respectively, and it is in theory applicable
              to a wide variety of disorders. To validate the clinical
              relevance of these methods, we quantified the prediction of
              behavioural deficits in a prospective cohort of 132 first-time
              stroke patients studied at 2 weeks post-injury (mean age 52.8
              years, range 22-77; 63 females; 64 right hemispheres).
              Specifically, we used multivariate ridge regression to relate
              deficits in multiple functional domains (left and right visual,
              left and right motor, language, spatial attention, spatial and
              verbal memory) with the pattern of lesion and indirect structural
              or functional disconnection. In a subgroup of patients, we also
              measured direct alterations of functional connectivity with
              resting-state functional MRI. Both lesion and indirect structural
              disconnection maps were predictive of behavioural impairment in
              all domains (0.16 < R2 < 0.58) except for verbal memory (0.05 <
              R2 < 0.06). Prediction from indirect functional disconnection was
              scarce or negligible (0.01 < R2 < 0.18) except for the right
              visual field deficits (R2 = 0.38), even though multivariate maps
              were anatomically plausible in all domains. Prediction from
              direct measures of functional MRI functional connectivity in a
              subset of patients was clearly superior to indirect functional
              disconnection. In conclusion, the indirect estimation of
              structural connectivity damage successfully predicted behavioural
              deficits post-stroke to a level comparable to lesion information.
              However, indirect estimation of functional disconnection did not
              predict behavioural deficits, nor was a substitute for direct
              functional connectivity measurements, especially for cognitive

  abstract = "Stroke has long been regarded as focal disease with circumscribed
              damage leading to neurological deficits. However, advances in
              methods for assessing the human brain and in statistics have
              enabled new tools for the examination of the consequences of
              stroke on brain structure and function. Thereby, it has become
              evident that stroke has impact on the entire brain and its
              network properties and can therefore be considered as a network
              disease. The present review first gives an overview of current
              methodological opportunities and pitfalls for assessing
              stroke-induced changes and reorganization in the human brain. We
              then summarize principles of plasticity after stroke that have
              emerged from the assessment of networks. Thereby, it is shown
              that neurological deficits do not only arise from focal tissue
              damage but also from local and remote changes in white-matter
              tracts and in neural interactions among wide-spread networks.
              Similarly, plasticity and clinical improvements are associated
              with specific compensatory structural and functional patterns of

              unclear. Here, we examined the direct and indirect effects of
              structural disconnections on resting-state functional
              connectivity in a large sample of sub-acute stroke patients with
              heterogeneous brain lesions. We estimated the impact of each
              patient's lesion on the structural connectome by embedding the
              lesion in a diffusion MRI streamline tractography atlas
              constructed using data from healthy individuals. We defined
              direct disconnections as the loss of direct structural
              connections between two regions, and indirect disconnections as
              increases in the shortest structural path length between two
              regions that lack direct structural connections. We then tested
              the hypothesis that functional connectivity disruptions would be
              more severe for disconnected regions than for regions with spared
              connections. On average, nearly 20\% of all region pairs were
              estimated to be either directly or indirectly disconnected by the
              lesions in our sample, and extensive disconnections were
              associated primarily with damage to deep white matter locations.
              Importantly, both directly and indirectly disconnected region
              pairs showed more severe functional connectivity disruptions than
              region pairs with spared direct and indirect connections,
              respectively, although functional connectivity disruptions tended
              to be most severe between region pairs that sustained direct
              structural disconnections. Together, these results emphasize the
              widespread impacts of focal brain lesions on the structural
              connectome and show that these impacts are reflected by
              disruptions of the functional connectome. Further, they indicate
              that in addition to direct structural disconnections,
              lesion-induced increases in the structural shortest path lengths
              between indirectly structurally connected region pairs provide

              known about the function of these higher-order motor areas during
              simple voluntary movement. We examined a simple finger flexion
              movement in six healthy subjects using a novel brain-imaging
              approach, integrating high-resolution EEG with the individual
              structural and functional MRI. Electrical source reconstruction
              was performed in respect to the individual brain morphology from

              for both executive and higher-order motor areas. All subjects
              showed activation of the primary motor area (MI) and of the
              frontal medial wall motor areas. Two different types of medial
              wall activation were observed with both methods: Four of the
              subjects showed an anterior type of activation, and two of the
              subjects a posterior type of activation. In the former, activity
              started in the anterior cingulate motor area (CMA) and
              subsequently shifted its focus to the intermediate supplementary
              motor area (SMA). Approximately 120 ms before the movement
              started, the intermediate SMA showed a drop of source strength,
              and simultaneously MI showed an increase of source strength. In
              the posterior type, activation was restricted to the posterior
              SMA. Further, three of the subjects investigated showed
              activation in the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) starting during
              early movement preparation. In all subjects showing activation of
              higher-order motor areas (anterior CMA, intermediate SMA, IPL)
              these areas became active before the executive motor areas (MI
              and posterior SMA). We suggest that the early activation of the
              anterior CMA and the IPL may be related to attentional functions
              of these areas. Further, we argue that the intermediate part of
              the SMA triggers the actual motor act via the release of
              inhibition of the primary motor area. Our results demonstrate
              that a noninvasive, multimodal brain imaging technique can reveal
              individual cortical brain activity with high temporal and spatial

              task as measured using functional MRI (fMRI). Eight first-ever
              stroke patients presenting with hemiparesis resulting from
              cerebral infarction sparing the primary motor cortex, and four
              control subjects were recruited. Subjects were scanned on a

              assessed using a battery of outcome measures at each time point.
              Task-related brain activations decreased over sessions as a
              function of recovery in a number of primary and non-primary motor
              regions in all patients, but no session effects were seen in the

              identify dynamic changes in the functional organization,
              particularly topological characteristics, of the motor execution
              network during the stroke recovery process. Ten patients (nine
              male and one female) with subcortical infarctions were assessed
              by neurological examination and scanned with resting-state
              functional magnetic resonance imaging across five consecutive
              time points in a single year. The motor execution network of each
              subject was constructed using a functional connectivity matrix
              between 21 brain regions and subsequently analysed using graph
              theoretical approaches. Dynamic changes in topological
              configuration of the network during the process of recovery were
              evaluated by a mixed model. We found that the motor execution
              network gradually shifted towards a random mode during the
              recovery process, which suggests that a less optimized
              reorganization is involved in regaining function in the affected
              limbs. Significantly increased regional centralities within the
              network were observed in the ipsilesional primary motor area and
              contralesional cerebellum, whereas the ipsilesional cerebellum
              showed decreased regional centrality. Functional connectivity to
              these brain regions demonstrated consistent alterations over
              time. Notably, these measures correlated with different clinical
              variables, which provided support that the findings may reflect
              the adaptive reorganization of the motor execution network in
              stroke patients. In conclusion, the study expands our
              understanding of the spectrum of changes occurring in the brain
