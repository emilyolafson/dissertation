    Measurement of stroke recovery is complex because definition of successful
  recovery is highly variable across measures and cut-off points for defining
  successful outcomes vary. The purpose of this paper is to describe patterns
  of recovery in stroke patients of varying severity when different measures
  are used and when different cut-off points are selected. 459 individuals
  enrolled in a prospective cohort study were assessed within 14 days post
  stroke and re-evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months. Recovery was assessed using
  the NIH Stroke Scale, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery, the
  Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living, the Physical Function Index of
  the SF-36, and the Modified Rankin Outcome Scale. Subjects also defined their
  preference (utility) for their current health state with a time-trade off
  question. We compared patterns of recovery using the different measures and
  varying the cut-off points for defining successful recovery. The percentage
  of patients who are believed to have recovered depends on how recovery is
  defined. If recovery is defined at the disability level (Barthel > 90), the
  majority 57.3\% of stroke survivors experience a full recovery. Fewer
  individuals are considered to be fully recovered if impairments are measured
  (NIH 90, 36.8\%. Less than 25\% of stroke survivors are considered recovered
  if recovery is defined relative to reported prior function in higher levels
  of physical activity. Shifting the definition of recovery on the modified
  Rankin scale from </= 1 to </= 2 shifts the percentage of those deemed
  recovered from </= 25\% to 53.8\%. In designing drug trials the methods for
  defining stroke recovery should be carefully considered. If recovery is
  defined in terms of disability, a higher proportion of the placebo group will
  achieve the outcome than if impairments are used to define recovery. The
  benchmarks for recovery in minor strokes must include measures of higher
  functioning (e.g. the SF-36 physical functioning index or a Rankin 0 (no
  symptoms).%

    OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at identifying the impact of subcortical stroke
  on the interaction of cortical motor areas within and across hemispheres
  during the generation of voluntary hand movements. METHODS: Twelve subacute
  stroke patients with a subcortical ischemic lesion and 12 age-matched control
  subjects were scanned using 3-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging.
  Subjects performed visually paced hand movements with their left, right, or
  both hands. Changes of effective connectivity among a bilateral network of
  core motor regions comprising M1, lateral premotor cortex, and the
  supplementary motor area (SMA) were assessed using dynamic causal modeling.
  RESULTS: The data showed significant disturbances in the effective
  connectivity of motor areas in the patients group: Independently from hand
  movements, the intrinsic neural coupling between ipsilesional SMA and M1, and
  the interhemispheric coupling of both SMAs was significantly reduced.
  Furthermore, movements of the stroke-affected hand showed additional
  inhibitory influences from contralesional to ipsilesional M1 that correlated
  with the degree of motor impairment. For bimanual movements, interhemispheric
  communication between ipsilesional SMA and contralesional M1 was
  significantly reduced, which also correlated with impaired bimanual
  performance. INTERPRETATION: The motor deficit of patients with a single
  subcortical lesion is associated with pathological interhemispheric
  interactions among key motor areas. The data suggest that a dysfunction
  between ipsilesional and contralesional M1, and between ipsilesional SMA and
  contralesional M1 underlies hand motor disability after stroke. Assessing
  effective connectivity by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging and
  dynamic causal modeling might be used in the future for the evaluation of
  interventions promoting recovery of function.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Stroke causes a sudden disruption of physiological brain function which
  leads to impairments of functional brain networks involved in voluntary
  movements. In some cases, the brain has the intrinsic capacity to reorganize
  itself, thereby compensating for the disruption of motor networks. In humans,
  such reorganization can be investigated in vivo using neuroimaging. Recent
  developments in connectivity analyses based on functional neuroimaging data
  have provided new insights into the network pathophysiology underlying
  neurological symptoms. Here we review recent neuroimaging studies using
  functional resting-state correlations, effective connectivity models or graph
  theoretical analyses to investigate changes in neural motor networks and
  recovery after stroke. The data demonstrate that network disturbances after
  stroke occur not only in the vicinity of the lesion but also between remote
  cortical areas in the affected and unaffected hemisphere. The reorganization
  of motor networks encompasses a restoration of interhemispheric functional
  coherence in the resting state, particularly between the primary motor
  cortices. Furthermore, reorganized neural networks feature strong excitatory
  interactions between fronto-parietal areas and primary motor cortex in the
  affected hemisphere, suggesting that greater top-down control over primary
  motor areas facilitates motor execution in the lesioned brain. In addition,
  there is evidence that motor recovery is accompanied by a more random network
  topology with reduced local information processing. In conclusion, Stroke
  induces changes in functional and effective connectivity within and across
  hemispheres which relate to motor impairments and recovery thereof.
  Connectivity analyses may hence provide new insights into the pathophysiology
  underlying neurological deficits and may be further used to develop novel,
  neurobiologically informed treatment strategies.%

    Together, thousands of neurons with similar function make up
  topographically oriented sensory cortex maps that represent contralateral
  body parts. Although this is an accepted model for the adult cortex, whether
  these same rules hold after stroke-induced damage is unclear. After stroke,
  sensory representations damaged by stroke remap onto nearby surviving
  neurons. Here, we review the process of sensory remapping after stroke at
  multiple levels ranging from the initial damage to synapses, to their
  rewiring and function in intact sensory circuits. We introduce a new approach
  using in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging to determine how the response
  properties of individual somatosensory cortex neurons are altered during
  remapping. One month after forelimb-area stroke, normally highly
  limb-selective neurons in surviving peri-infarct areas exhibit remarkable
  flexibility and begin to process sensory stimuli from multiple limbs as
  remapping proceeds. Two months after stroke, neurons within remapped regions
  develop a stronger response preference. Thus, remapping is initiated by
  surviving neurons adopting new roles in addition to their usual function.
  Later in recovery, these remapped forelimb-responsive neurons become more
  selective, but their new topographical representation may encroach on map
  territories of neurons that process sensory stimuli from other body parts.
  Neurons responding to multiple limbs may reflect a transitory phase in the
  progression from their involvement in one sensorimotor function to a new
  function that replaces processing lost due to stroke.%

    Visual extinction has been characterized by the failure to respond to a
  visual stimulus in the contralesional hemifield when presented simultaneously
  with an ipsilesional stimulus (Corbetta and Shulman, 2011). Unilateral damage
  to the macaque frontoparietal cortex commonly leads to deficits in
  contralesional target selection that resemble visual extinction. Recently, we
  showed that macaque monkeys with unilateral lesions in the caudal prefrontal
  cortex (PFC) exhibited contralesional target selection deficits that
  recovered over 2-4 months (Adam et al., 2019). Here, we investigated the
  longitudinal changes in functional connectivity (FC) of the frontoparietal
  network after a small or large right caudal PFC lesion in four macaque
  monkeys. We collected ultra-high field resting-state fMRI at 7-T before the
  lesion and at weeks 1-16 post-lesion and compared the functional data with
  behavioural performance on a free-choice saccade task. We found that the
  pattern of frontoparietal network FC changes depended on lesion size, such
  that the recovery of contralesional extinction was associated with an initial
  increase in network FC that returned to baseline in the two small lesion
  monkeys, whereas FC continued to increase throughout recovery in the two
  monkeys with a larger lesion. We also found that the FC between
  contralesional dorsolateral PFC and ipsilesional parietal cortex correlated
  with behavioural recovery and that the contralesional dorsolateral PFC showed
  increasing degree centrality with the frontoparietal network. These findings
  suggest that both the contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres play an
  important role in the recovery of function. Importantly, optimal compensation
  after large PFC lesions may require greater recruitment of distant and intact
  areas of the frontoparietal network, whereas recovery from smaller lesions
  was supported by a normalization of the functional network.%

    The question of how intensive motor training restores motor function after
  brain damage or stroke remains unresolved. Here we show that the ipsilesional
  ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and perilesional primary motor cortex (M1) of
  rhesus macaque monkeys are involved in the recovery of manual dexterity after
  a lesion of M1. A focal lesion of the hand digit area in M1 was made by means
  of ibotenic acid injection. This lesion initially caused flaccid paralysis in
  the contralateral hand but was followed by functional recovery of hand
  movements, including precision grip, during the course of daily postlesion
  motor training. Brain imaging of regional cerebral blood flow by means of H2
  (15)O-positron emission tomography revealed enhanced activity of the PMv
  during the early postrecovery period and increased functional connectivity
  within M1 during the late postrecovery period. The causal role of these areas
  in motor recovery was confirmed by means of pharmacological inactivation by
  muscimol during the different recovery periods. These findings indicate that,
  in both the remaining primary motor and premotor cortical areas,
  time-dependent plastic changes in neural activity and connectivity are
  involved in functional recovery from the motor deficit caused by the M1
  lesion. Therefore, it is likely that the PMv, an area distant from the core
  of the lesion, plays an important role during the early postrecovery period,
  whereas the perilesional M1 contributes to functional recovery especially
  during the late postrecovery period.%

    After brain damage such as stroke, topographically organized sensory and
  motor cortical representations remap onto adjacent surviving tissues. It is
  conceivable that cortical remapping is accomplished by changes in the
  temporal precision of sensory processing and regional connectivity in the
  cortex. To understand how the adult cortex remaps and processes sensory
  signals during stroke recovery, we performed in vivo imaging of
  sensory-evoked changes in membrane potential, as well as multiphoton imaging
  of dendrite structure and tract tracing. In control mice, forelimb
  stimulation evoked a brief depolarization in forelimb cortex that quickly
  propagated to, and dissipated within, adjacent motor/hindlimb areas (<100
  ms). One week after forelimb cortex stroke, the cortex was virtually
  unresponsive to tactile forelimb stimulation. After 8 weeks recovery,
  forelimb-evoked depolarizations reemerged with a characteristic pattern in
  which responses began within surviving portions of forelimb cortex (<20 ms
  after stimulation) and then spread horizontally into neighboring peri-infarct
  motor/hindlimb areas in which depolarization persisted 300-400\% longer than
  controls. These uncharacteristically prolonged responses were not limited to
  the remapped peri-infarct zone and included distant posteromedial
  retrosplenial cortex, millimeters from the stroke. Structurally, the remapped
  peri-infarct area selectively exhibited high levels of dendritic spine
  turnover, shared more connections with retrosplenial cortex and striatum, and
  lost inputs from lateral somatosensory cortical regions. Our findings
  demonstrate that sensory remapping during stroke recovery is accompanied by
  the development of prolonged sensory responses and new structural circuits in
  both the peri-infarct zone as well as more distant sites.%

    Recovery of motor function after stroke may occur over weeks or months and
  is often attributed to cerebral reorganization. We have investigated the
  longitudinal relationship between recovery after stroke and task-related
  brain activation during a motor task as measured using functional MRI (fMRI).
  Eight first-ever stroke patients presenting with hemiparesis resulting from
  cerebral infarction sparing the primary motor cortex, and four control
  subjects were recruited. Subjects were scanned on a number of occasions
  whilst performing an isometric dynamic visually paced hand grip task.
  Recovery in the patient group was assessed using a battery of outcome
  measures at each time point. Task-related brain activations decreased over
  sessions as a function of recovery in a number of primary and non-primary
  motor regions in all patients, but no session effects were seen in the
  controls. Furthermore, consistent decreases across sessions correlating with
  recovery were seen across the whole patient group independent of rate of
  recovery or initial severity, in primary motor cortex, premotor and
  prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor areas, cingulate sulcus, temporal
  lobe, striate cortex, cerebellum, thalamus and basal ganglia. Although
  recovery-related increases were seen in different brain regions in four
  patients, there were no consistent effects across the group. These results
  further our understanding of the recovery process by demonstrating for the
  first time a clear temporal relationship between recovery and task-related
  activation of the motor system after stroke.%

    BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Functional MRI (fMRI) studies could provide crucial
  information on the neural mechanisms of motor recovery in patients with
  stroke. Resting-state fMRI is applicable to patients with stroke who are not
  capable of proper performance of the motor task. In this study, we explored
  neural correlates of motor recovery in patients with stroke by investigating
  longitudinal changes in resting-state functional connectivity of the
  ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: A longitudinal observational
  study using repeated fMRI experiments was conducted in 12 patients with
  stroke. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired 4 times over a period of 6
  months. Patients participated in the first session of fMRI shortly after
  onset and thereafter in subsequent sessions at 1, 3, and 6 months after
  onset. Resting-state functional connectivity of the ipsilesional M1 was
  assessed and compared with that of healthy subjects. RESULTS: Compared with
  healthy subjects, patients demonstrated higher functional connectivity with
  the ipsilesional frontal and parietal cortices, bilateral thalamus, and
  cerebellum. Instead, functional connectivity with the contralesional M1 and
  occipital cortex were decreased in patients with stroke. Functional
  connectivity between the ipsilesional and contralesional M1 showed the most
  asymmetry at 1 month after onset to the ipsilesional side. Functional
  connectivity of the ipsilesional M1 with the contralesional thalamus,
  supplementary motor area, and middle frontal gyrus at onset was positively
  correlated with motor recovery at 6 months after stroke. CONCLUSIONS:
  Resting-state fMRI elicited distinctive but comparable results with previous
  task-based fMRI, presenting complementary and practical values for use in the
  study of patients with stroke.%

    Intrinsic functional connectivity detected by functional MRI (fMRI)
  provides a useful but indirect approach to study the organization of human
  brain systems. An unresolved question is whether functional connectivity
  measured by resting-state fMRI reflects anatomical connections. In this
  study, we used the well-characterized anatomy of cerebrocerebellar circuits
  to directly test whether intrinsic functional connectivity is associated with
  an anatomic pathway. Eleven first-episode stroke patients were scanned five
  times during a period of 6 months, and 11 healthy control subjects were
  scanned three times within 1 month. In patients with right pontine strokes,
  the functional connectivity between the right motor cortex and the left
  cerebellum was selectively reduced. This connectivity pattern was reversed in
  patients with left pontine strokes. Although factors beyond anatomical
  connectivity contribute to fMRI measures of functional correlation, these
  results provide direct evidence that functional connectivity depends on
  intact connections within a specific polysynaptic pathway.%

    OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of isolated pontine infarctions is still
  unclear, being attributed both to small or large vessel disease. The
  extension of infarcted tissue to the pons surface has been indicated as a
  possible marker of basilar branch atheromatous disease and some neuroimaging
  evidence confirms this finding. METHODS: On the basis of Kim's et al., study,
  we performed a revision of the literature addressing this topic. RESULTS:
  Several authors confirm an association between basilar artery branch disease
  and isolated pontine infarction; moreover, the enlargement of pontine lesion
  seems to be associated with neurological worsening. We therefore performed a
  brief analysis of possible mechanisms of progression. CONCLUSIONS:
  Prospective studies could be useful to evaluate predictors of neurological
  worsening in pontine stroke. Improvement of neuroimaging techniques is needed
  for a deeper comprehension of the etiopathogenesis of isolated pontine
  infarction.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    After a century of false hopes, recent studies have placed the concept of
  diaschisis at the centre of the understanding of brain function. Originally,
  the term 'diaschisis' was coined by von Monakow in 1914 to describe the
  neurophysiological changes that occur distant to a focal brain lesion. In the
  following decades, this concept triggered widespread clinical interest in an
  attempt to describe symptoms and signs that the lesion could not fully
  explain. However, the first imaging studies, in the late 1970s, only
  partially confirmed the clinical significance of diaschisis. Focal cortical
  areas of diaschisis (i.e. focal diaschisis) contributed to the clinical
  deficits after subcortical but only rarely after cortical lesions. For this
  reason, the concept of diaschisis progressively disappeared from the
  mainstream of research in clinical neurosciences. Recent evidence has
  unexpectedly revitalized the notion. The development of new imaging
  techniques allows a better understanding of the complexity of brain
  organization. It is now possible to reliably investigate a new type of
  diaschisis defined as the changes of structural and functional connectivity
  between brain areas distant to the lesion (i.e. connectional diaschisis). As
  opposed to focal diaschisis, connectional diaschisis, focusing on determined
  networks, seems to relate more consistently to the clinical findings. This is
  particularly true after stroke in the motor and attentional networks.
  Furthermore, normalization of remote connectivity changes in these networks
  relates to a better recovery. In the future, to investigate the clinical role
  of diaschisis, a systematic approach has to be considered. First, emerging
  imaging and electrophysiological techniques should be used to precisely map
  and selectively model brain lesions in human and animals studies. Second, the
  concept of diaschisis must be applied to determine the impact of a focal
  lesion on new representations of the complexity of brain organization. As an
  example, the evaluation of remote changes in the structure of the connectome
  has so far mainly been tested by modelization of focal brain lesions. These
  changes could now be assessed in patients suffering from focal brain lesions
  (i.e. connectomal diaschisis). Finally, and of major significance, focal and
  non-focal neurophysiological changes distant to the lesion should be the
  target of therapeutic strategies. Neuromodulation using transcranial magnetic
  stimulation is one of the most promising techniques. It is when this last
  step will be successful that the concept of diaschisis will gain all the
  clinical respectability that could not be obtained in decades of research.%

    Focal brain lesions disrupt resting-state functional connectivity, but the
  underlying structural mechanisms are unclear. Here, we examined the direct
  and indirect effects of structural disconnections on resting-state functional
  connectivity in a large sample of sub-acute stroke patients with
  heterogeneous brain lesions. We estimated the impact of each patient's lesion
  on the structural connectome by embedding the lesion in a diffusion MRI
  streamline tractography atlas constructed using data from healthy
  individuals. We defined direct disconnections as the loss of direct
  structural connections between two regions, and indirect disconnections as
  increases in the shortest structural path length between two regions that
  lack direct structural connections. We then tested the hypothesis that
  functional connectivity disruptions would be more severe for disconnected
  regions than for regions with spared connections. On average, nearly 20\% of
  all region pairs were estimated to be either directly or indirectly
  disconnected by the lesions in our sample, and extensive disconnections were
  associated primarily with damage to deep white matter locations. Importantly,
  both directly and indirectly disconnected region pairs showed more severe
  functional connectivity disruptions than region pairs with spared direct and
  indirect connections, respectively, although functional connectivity
  disruptions tended to be most severe between region pairs that sustained
  direct structural disconnections. Together, these results emphasize the
  widespread impacts of focal brain lesions on the structural connectome and
  show that these impacts are reflected by disruptions of the functional
  connectome. Further, they indicate that in addition to direct structural
  disconnections, lesion-induced increases in the structural shortest path
  lengths between indirectly structurally connected region pairs provide
  information about the remote functional disruptions caused by focal brain
  lesions.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The brain can be considered as an information processing network, where
  complex behavior manifests as a result of communication between large-scale
  functional systems such as visual and default mode networks. As the
  communication between brain regions occurs through underlying anatomical
  pathways, it is important to define a ``traffic pattern'' that properly
  describes how the regions exchange information. Empirically, the choice of
  the traffic pattern can be made based on how well the functional connectivity
  between regions matches the structural pathways equipped with that traffic
  pattern. In this paper, we present a multimodal connectomics paradigm
  utilizing graph matching to measure similarity between structural and
  functional connectomes (derived from dMRI and fMRI data) at node, system, and
  connectome level. Through an investigation of the brain's structure-function
  relationship over a large cohort of 641 healthy developmental participants
  aged 8-22 years, we demonstrate that communicability as the traffic pattern
  describes the functional connectivity of the brain best, with large-scale
  systems having significant agreement between their structural and functional
  connectivity patterns. Notably, matching between structural and functional
  connectivity for the functionally specialized modular systems such as visual
  and motor networks are higher as compared to other more integrated systems.
  Additionally, we show that the negative functional connectivity between the
  default mode network (DMN) and motor, frontoparietal, attention, and visual
  networks is significantly associated with its underlying structural
  connectivity, highlighting the counterbalance between functional activation
  patterns of DMN and other systems. Finally, we investigated sex difference
  and developmental changes in brain and observed that similarity between
  structure and function changes with development.%

    Resting state functional connectivity reveals intrinsic, spontaneous
  networks that elucidate the functional architecture of the human brain.
  However, valid statistical analysis used to identify such networks must
  address sources of noise in order to avoid possible confounds such as
  spurious correlations based on non-neuronal sources. We have developed a
  functional connectivity toolbox Conn ( www.nitrc.org/projects/conn ) that
  implements the component-based noise correction method (CompCor) strategy for
  physiological and other noise source reduction, additional removal of
  movement, and temporal covariates, temporal filtering and windowing of the
  residual blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast signal, first-level
  estimation of multiple standard functional connectivity magnetic resonance
  imaging (fcMRI) measures, and second-level random-effect analysis for resting
  state as well as task-related data. Compared to methods that rely on global
  signal regression, the CompCor noise reduction method allows for
  interpretation of anticorrelations as there is no regression of the global
  signal. The toolbox implements fcMRI measures, such as estimation of
  seed-to-voxel and region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI functional correlations, as
  well as semipartial correlation and bivariate/multivariate regression
  analysis for multiple ROI sources, graph theoretical analysis, and novel
  voxel-to-voxel analysis of functional connectivity. We describe the methods
  implemented in the Conn toolbox for the analysis of fcMRI data, together with
  examples of use and interscan reliability estimates of all the implemented
  fcMRI measures. The results indicate that the CompCor method increases the
  sensitivity and selectivity of fcMRI analysis, and show a high degree of
  interscan reliability for many fcMRI measures.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    A component based method (CompCor) for the reduction of noise in both blood
  oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) and perfusion-based functional magnetic
  resonance imaging (fMRI) data is presented. In the proposed method,
  significant principal components are derived from noise regions-of-interest
  (ROI) in which the time series data are unlikely to be modulated by neural
  activity. These components are then included as nuisance parameters within
  general linear models for BOLD and perfusion-based fMRI time series data. Two
  approaches for the determination of the noise ROI are considered. The first
  method uses high-resolution anatomical data to define a region of interest
  composed primarily of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, while the second
  method defines a region based upon the temporal standard deviation of the
  time series data. With the application of CompCor, the temporal standard
  deviation of resting-state perfusion and BOLD data in gray matter regions was
  significantly reduced as compared to either no correction or the application
  of a previously described retrospective image based correction scheme
  (RETROICOR). For both functional perfusion and BOLD data, the application of
  CompCor significantly increased the number of activated voxels as compared to
  no correction. In addition, for functional BOLD data, there were
  significantly more activated voxels detected with CompCor as compared to
  RETROICOR. In comparison to RETROICOR, CompCor has the advantage of not
  requiring external monitoring of physiological fluctuations.%

    Here, we demonstrate that subject motion produces substantial changes in
  the timecourses of resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) data
  despite compensatory spatial registration and regression of motion estimates
  from the data. These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation
  structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many long-distance
  correlations are decreased by subject motion, whereas many short-distance
  correlations are increased. These changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not
  arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional
  connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and
  a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is
  demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a variety of
  software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts
  our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development. These
  results suggest the need for greater care in dealing with subject motion, and
  the need to critically revisit previous rs-fcMRI work that may not have
  adequately controlled for effects of transient subject movements.%

    In this paper, we present a groupwise graph-theory-based parcellation
  approach to define nodes for network analysis. The application of
  network-theory-based analysis to extend the utility of functional MRI has
  recently received increased attention. Such analyses require first and
  foremost a reasonable definition of a set of nodes as input to the network
  analysis. To date many applications have used existing atlases based on
  cytoarchitecture, task-based fMRI activations, or anatomic delineations. A
  potential pitfall in using such atlases is that the mean timecourse of a node
  may not represent any of the constituent timecourses if different functional
  areas are included within a single node. The proposed approach involves a
  groupwise optimization that ensures functional homogeneity within each
  subunit and that these definitions are consistent at the group level.
  Parcellation reproducibility of each subunit is computed across multiple
  groups of healthy volunteers and is demonstrated to be high. Issues related
  to the selection of appropriate number of nodes in the brain are considered.
  Within typical parameters of fMRI resolution, parcellation results are shown
  for a total of 100, 200, and 300 subunits. Such parcellations may ultimately
  serve as a functional atlas for fMRI and as such three atlases at the 100-,
  200- and 300-parcellation levels derived from 79 healthy normal volunteers
  are made freely available online along with tools to interface this atlas
  with SPM, BioImage Suite and other analysis packages.%

    The relationship between structural and functional connectivity has been
  mostly examined in intact brains. Fewer studies have examined how differences
  in structure as a result of injury alters function. In this study we analyzed
  the relationship of structure to function across patients with stroke among
  whom infarcts caused heterogenous structural damage. We estimated
  relationships between distinct brain regions of interest (ROIs) from
  functional MRI in two pipelines. In one analysis pipeline, we measured
  functional connectivity by using correlation and partial correlation between
  114 cortical ROIs. We found fMRI-BOLD partial correlation was altered at more
  edges as a function of the structural connectome (SC) damage, relative to the
  correlation. In a second analysis pipeline, we limited our analysis to fMRI
  correlations between pairs of voxels for which we possess SC information. We
  found that voxel-level functional connectivity showed the effect of
  structural damage that we could not see when examining correlations between
  ROIs. Further, the effects of structural damage on functional connectivity
  are consistent with a model of functional connectivity, diffusion, which
  expects functional connectivity to result from activity spreading over
  multiple edge anatomical paths.%

  SC because they capture ?direct? statistical dependencies, i.e., discarding
  the effects of mediators, but their use has been limited because of
  estimation issues. With the rise of high-quality and large neuroimaging
  datasets, we revisit relevance of different FC metrics in the context of
  SC-FC comparisons. Using data from 100 unrelated HCP subjects, we first
  explore the amount of functional data required to reliably estimate various
  FC metrics. We find that precision-based FC yields a better match to SC than
  correlation-based FC when using 5 minutes of functional data or more.
  Finally, using a linear model linking SC and FC, we show that the SC-FC match
  can be used to further interrogate various aspects of brain structure and
  function such as the timescales of functional dynamics in different
  resting-state networks or the intensity of anatomical self-connections.%

    Discretizations of inverse problems lead to systems of linear equations

    We have hypothesized that most cases of aphasia or hemispatial neglect due
  to acute, subcortical infarct can be accounted for by concurrent cortical
  hypoperfusion. To test this hypothesis, we demonstrate: (i) that pure
  subcortical infarctions are associated with cortical hypoperfusion in
  subjects with aphasia/neglect; (ii) that reversal of cortical hypoperfusion
  is associated with resolution of the aphasia; and (iii) that aphasia/neglect
  strongly predicts cortical ischaemia and/or hypoperfusion. We prospectively
  evaluated a consecutive series of 115 patients who presented within 24 h of
  onset or progression of stroke symptoms, with MRI sequences including
  diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion weighted imaging (PWI), and
  detailed testing for aphasia or hemispatial neglect. The association between
  aphasia or neglect and cortical infarct (or dense ischaemia) on DWI and
  cortical hypoperfusion indicated by PWI, was evaluated with chi-squared
  analyses. Fisher exact tests were used for analyses with small samples. Cases
  of DWI lesion restricted to subcortical white matter and/or grey matter
  structures (n = 44) were examined for the presence of aphasia or neglect, and
  for the presence of cortical hypoperfusion. In addition, subjects who
  received intervention to restore perfusion were evaluated with DWI, PWI, and
  cognitive tests before and after intervention. Finally, the positive
  predictive value of the cognitive deficits for identifying cortical
  abnormalities on DWI and PWI were calculated from all patients. Of the
  subjects with only subcortical lesions on DWI in this study (n = 44), all
  those who had aphasia or neglect showed concurrent cortical hypoperfusion.
  Among the patients who received intervention that successfully restored
  cortical perfusion, 100\% (six out of six) showed immediate resolution of
  aphasia. In the 115 patients, aphasia and neglect were much more strongly
  associated with cortical hypoperfusion (chi(2) = 57.3 for aphasia; chi(2) =
  28.7 for neglect; d.f. = 1; P < 0.000001 for each), than with cortical
  infarct/ischaemia on DWI (chi(2) = 8.5 for aphasia; chi(2) = 9.7 for neglect;
  d.f. = 1; P < 0.005 for each). Aphasia showed a much higher positive
  predictive value for cortical abnormality on PWI (95\%) than on DWI (62\%),
  as did neglect (100\% positive predictive value for PWI versus 74\% for DWI).
  From these data we conclude that aphasia and neglect due to acute subcortical
  stroke can be largely explained by cortical hypoperfusion.%

    A long-held view is that stroke causes many distinct neurological syndromes
  due to damage of specialized cortical and subcortical centers. However, it is
  unknown if a syndrome-based description is helpful in characterizing
  behavioral deficits across a large number of patients. We studied a large
  prospective sample of first-time stroke patients with heterogeneous lesions
  at 1-2 weeks post-stroke. We measured behavior over multiple domains and
  lesion anatomy with structural MRI and a probabilistic atlas of white matter
  pathways. Multivariate methods estimated the percentage of behavioral
  variance explained by structural damage. A few clusters of behavioral
  deficits spanning multiple functions explained neurological impairment.
  Stroke topography was predominantly subcortical, and disconnection of white
  matter tracts critically contributed to behavioral deficits and their
  correlation. The locus of damage explained more variance for motor and
  language than memory or attention deficits. Our findings highlight the need
  for better models of white matter damage on cognition.%

    OBJECTIVE: To study remote effects distant from acute ischemic infarcts by
  measuring longitudinal changes of cortical thickness in connected brain
  regions as well as changes in microstructural integrity in connecting fiber
  tracts. METHODS: Thirty-two patients (mean age 71 years) underwent a
  standardized protocol including multimodal MRI and clinical assessment both
  at stroke onset and 6 months after the event. Cortex connected to acute
  infarcts was identified by probabilistic diffusion tensor tractography
  starting from the acute lesion. Changes of cortical thickness were measured
  using the longitudinal stream of FreeSurfer. Microstructural damage in white
  matter tracts was assessed by changes of mean diffusivity. RESULTS: We found
  focal cortical thinning specifically in areas connected to acute infarcts (p
  < 0.001). Thinning was more pronounced in regions showing a high probability
  of connectivity to infarcts. Microstructural damage in white matter tracts
  connecting acute infarcts with distant cortex significantly correlated with
  thickness changes in that region ($\rho$ = -0.39, p = 0.028). There was no
  indication of an influence of cavitation status or infarct etiology on the
  observed changes in cortex and white matter. CONCLUSIONS: These findings
  identify secondary degeneration of connected white matter tracts and remote
  cortex as key features of acute ischemic infarcts. Our observations may have
  implications for the understanding of structural and functional
  reorganization after stroke.%

    Cortical atrophy as demonstrated by measurement of cortical thickness (CT)
  is a hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases. In the wake of an acute
  ischemic stroke, brain architecture undergoes dynamic changes that can be
  tracked by structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies as
  soon as 3 months after stroke. In this study, we measured changes of CT in
  cortical areas connected to subcortical stroke lesions in 12 patients with
  upper extremity paresis combining white-matter tractography and
  semi-automatic measurement of CT using the Freesurfer software. Three months
  after stroke, a significant decrease in CT of -2.6\% (median, upper/lower
  boundary of 95\% confidence interval -4.1\%/-1.1\%) was detected in areas
  connected to ischemic lesions, whereas CT in unconnected cortical areas
  remained largely unchanged. A cluster of significant cortical thinning was
  detected in the superior frontal gyrus of the stroke hemisphere using a
  surface-based general linear model correcting for multiple comparisons. There
  was no significant correlation of changes in CT with clinical outcome
  parameters. Our results show a specific impact of subcortical lesions on
  distant, yet connected cortical areas explainable by secondary neuro-axonal

    Accurate prediction of brain dysfunction caused by disease or injury
  requires the quantification of resultant neural connectivity changes compared
  with the normal state. There are many methods with which to assess anatomical
  changes in structural or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, but most
  overlook the topology of white matter (WM) connections that make up the
  healthy brain network. Here, a new neuroimaging software pipeline called the
  Network Modification (NeMo) Tool is presented that associates alterations in
  WM integrity with expected changes in neural connectivity between gray matter
  regions. The NeMo Tool uses a large reference set of healthy tractograms to
  assess implied network changes arising from a particular pattern of WM
  alteration on a region- and network-wise level. In this way, WM integrity
  changes can be extrapolated to the cortices and deep brain nuclei, enabling
  assessment of functional and cognitive alterations. Unlike current techniques
  that assess network dysfunction, the NeMo tool does not require tractography
  in pathological brains for which the algorithms may be unreliable or
  diffusion data are unavailable. The versatility of the NeMo Tool is

    OBJECTIVE: Connectomics, the study of brain connectivity, has become an
  indispensable tool in neuroscientific research as it provides insights into
  brain organization. Connectomes are generated using different modalities such
  as diffusion MRI to capture structural organization of the brain or
  functional MRI to elaborate brain's functional organization. Understanding
  links between structural and functional organizations is crucial in
  explaining how observed behavior emerges from the underlying neurobiological
  mechanisms. Many studies have investigated how these two organizations relate
  to each other; however, we still lack a comparative understanding on how much
  variation should be expected in the two modalities, both between people and
  within a single person across scans. APPROACH: In this study, we
  systematically analyzed the consistency of connectomes, that is the
  similarity between connectomes in terms of individual connections between
  brain regions and in terms of overall network topology. We present a
  comprehensive study of consistency in connectomes for a single subject
  examined longitudinally and across a large cohort of subjects
  cross-sectionally, in structure and function separately. Within structural
  connectomes, we compared connectomes generated by different tracking
  algorithms, parcellations, edge weighting schemes, and edge pruning
  techniques. In functional connectomes, we compared full, positive, and
  negative connectivity separately along with thresholding of weak edges. We
  evaluated consistency using correlation (incorporating information at the
  level of individual edges) and graph matching accuracy (evaluating
  connectivity at the level of network topology). We also examined the
  consistency of connectomes that are generated using different communication
  schemes. MAIN RESULTS: Our results demonstrate varying degrees of consistency
  for the two modalities, with structural connectomes showing higher
  consistency than functional connectomes. Moreover, we observed a wide
  variation in consistency depending on how connectomes are generated.
  SIGNIFICANCE: Our study sets a reference point for consistency of connectome
  types, which is especially important for structure-function coupling studies
  in evaluating mismatches between modalities.%

    Reductions in blood flow to the brain of sufficient duration and extent

    The aim of this study is to compare the time-course changes in neurologic
  impairments (trunk control, motor function, sensory, and cognition) and
  recovery in functional impairments (activity of daily livings and gait)
  simultaneously from initiating rehabilitation to 6 months after stroke.
  Consecutive stroke patients were recruited from the department of nervous
  surgery, and transferred into the department of rehabilitation medicine and
  continued on treatment during the acute stage. Outcome measures were examined
  at the initial rehabilitation baseline, 1, 2, and 4 weeks after
  rehabilitation treatment, and 3, 4, 5, and 6 months after stroke. Patients
  were assessed using the Trunk Impairment Scale, the Fugl-Meyer Motor and
  Sensory Assessments for the upper and lower limbs, Mini-Mental State
  Examination, Functional Ambulation Category, and Modified Barthel Index.
  Twenty consecutive patients were analyzed in the study with complete
  assessments. The recovery was relatively rapid during the 4 weeks after
  treatment (P value ranges from <0.001 to <0.007) and then to a lesser extent
  decelerated between 3 and 6 months after stroke (P value between <0.001 and
  0.080). Statistical comparison by repeated measures analysis showed a
  significant interaction between time points and measures of all recovery
  variables (P<0.001). Significant differences in level of impairments and
  functional recovery were found at the different time points. In comparison
  with the lower leg and trunk control, the upper arm showed less recovery,
  with a significant difference. All variables except for leg motor function
  improved continuously over 6 months after stroke. Nevertheless, this study
  confirms the importance of the period within 3 months for recovery after
  stroke, during which most of the recovery occurred, ranging from 48 to 91\%.
  Therefore, intensive treatment targeting motor and sensory functions early
  after stroke may be beneficial for recovery of impairments and functional
  performance.%

    Traumatic brain injury damages white matter pathways that connect brain
  regions, disrupting transmission of electrochemical signals and causing
  cognitive and emotional dysfunction. Connectome-level mechanisms for how the
  brain compensates for injury have not been fully characterized. Here, we
  collected serial MRI-based structural and functional connectome metrics and
  neuropsychological scores in 26 mild traumatic brain injury subjects (29.4
  $\pm$ 8.0 years, 20 males) at 1 and 6 months postinjury. We quantified the
  relationship between functional and structural connectomes using network
  diffusion (ND) model propagation time, a measure that can be interpreted as
  how much of the structural connectome is being utilized for the spread of
  functional activation, as captured via the functional connectome. Overall
  cognition showed significant improvement from 1 to 6 months (t25 = -2.15, p =
  .04). None of the structural or functional global connectome metrics was
  significantly different between 1 and 6 months, or when compared to 34 age-
  and gender-matched controls (28.6 $\pm$ 8.8 years, 25 males). We predicted
  longitudinal changes in overall cognition from changes in global connectome
  measures using a partial least squares regression model (cross-validated R2 =
  .27). We observe that increased ND model propagation time, increased
  structural connectome segregation, and increased functional connectome
  integration were related to better cognitive recovery. We interpret these
  findings as suggesting two connectome-based postinjury recovery mechanisms:
  one of neuroplasticity that increases functional connectome integration and
  one of remote white matter degeneration that increases structural connectome
  segregation. We hypothesize that our inherently multimodal measure of ND
  model propagation time captures the interplay between these two mechanisms.%

    In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of neuronal populations are
  continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured using
  functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those
  populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity
  has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical)
  connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we
  investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level
  properties of functional networks--including their spatial statistics and
  their persistence across time--can be accounted for by properties of the
  underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional
  connectivity (using fMRI) and structural connectivity (using diffusion
  spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution.
  Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of
  macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i) that
  strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct
  structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity
  from functional connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and
  interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional
  connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and
  (iii) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within
  and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and
  modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional
  connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without
  direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics
  are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the
  human cerebral cortex.%

    Stroke has long been regarded as focal disease with circumscribed damage
  leading to neurological deficits. However, advances in methods for assessing
  the human brain and in statistics have enabled new tools for the examination
  of the consequences of stroke on brain structure and function. Thereby, it
  has become evident that stroke has impact on the entire brain and its network
  properties and can therefore be considered as a network disease. The present
  review first gives an overview of current methodological opportunities and
  pitfalls for assessing stroke-induced changes and reorganization in the human
  brain. We then summarize principles of plasticity after stroke that have
  emerged from the assessment of networks. Thereby, it is shown that
  neurological deficits do not only arise from focal tissue damage but also
  from local and remote changes in white-matter tracts and in neural
  interactions among wide-spread networks. Similarly, plasticity and clinical
  improvements are associated with specific compensatory structural and
  functional patterns of neural network interactions. Innovative treatment
  approaches have started to target such network patterns to enhance recovery.
  Network assessments to predict treatment response and to individualize
  rehabilitation is a promising way to enhance specific treatment effects and
  overall outcome after stroke.%

    Stroke causes focal brain lesions that disrupt functional connectivity
  (FC), a measure of activity synchronization, throughout distributed brain
  networks. It is often assumed that FC disruptions reflect damage to specific
  cortical regions. However, an alternative explanation is that they reflect
  the structural disconnection (SDC) of white matter pathways. Here, we compare
  these explanations using data from 114 stroke patients. Across multiple
  analyses, we find that SDC measures outperform focal damage measures,
  including damage to putative critical cortical regions, for explaining FC
  disruptions associated with stroke. We also identify a core mode of
  structure-function covariation that links the severity of interhemispheric
  SDCs to widespread FC disruptions across patients and that correlates with
  deficits in multiple behavioral domains. We conclude that a lesion's impact
  on the structural connectome is what determines its impact on FC and that
  interhemispheric SDCs may play a particularly important role in mediating FC
  disruptions after stroke.%

    The cerebellum is a major motor structure. However, in humans, its efferent
  topographical organization remains controversial and indirectly inferred from
  neuroimaging and animal studies. Even central questions such as 'Can we evoke
  limb movements by stimulating the cerebellar cortex?' have no clear answer.
  To address this issue, we electrically stimulated the posterior cerebellum of
  20 human patients undergoing surgery for tumours located outside this
  structure (e.g. pineal gland, quadrigeminal plate). Stimulation, delivered at
  a 60-Hz frequency for 2 s, evoked focal (single-joint) ipsilateral movements.
  Different regions were associated with the production of head (vermal lobule
  VI), face/mouth (hemispheric lobule VI) and lower-limb (hemispheric lobules
  VIIb-IX) responses. Upper-limb representations were more widely distributed.
  They intermingled with face/mouth representations in the superior posterior
  cerebellum (hemispheric lobule VI) and lower-limb representations in the
  inferior posterior cerebellum (hemispheric lobules VIIb-IX). No intra- or
  inter-limb somatotopy was found in these areas. Functionally, upper-limb
  (face/mouth movements) and upper limb-lower limb postural coordinations are
  major elements of our motor repertoire. Representation of these pairs of
  segments in common regions might favour the production of integrated motor
  behaviours. The intermediate region of the posterior cerebellum (hemispheric
  lobule VII and vermal lobules VII-VIII) was mostly silent. Latency results in
  conjunction with previous electrophysiological evidence in animals suggest
  that electrically evoked motor responses were not mediated by a cortical
  route but rather by brainstem structures. The potential role of this
  descending efferent pathway for fine motor control is discussed.%

    INTRODUCTION: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
  has been used to examine the brain mechanisms of stroke patients with
  hemiplegia, but the relationship between functional connectivity (FC) and
  treatment-induced motor function recovery has not yet been fully
  investigated. This study aimed to identify the brain FC changes in stroke
  patients and study the relationship between FC and motor function assessment
  using the resting-state fMRI. METHODS: Seventeen stroke patients with
  hemiplegia and fifteen healthy control subjects (HCSs) were recruited in this
  study. We compared the FC between the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1)
  and the whole brain of the patients with the FC of the HCSs and studied the
  FC changes in the patients before and after conventional rehabilitation and
  motor imagery therapy. Additionally, correlations between the FC change and
  motor function of the patients were studied. RESULTS: Compared to the HCSs,
  the FC in the patient group was significantly increased between the
  ipsilesional M1 and the ipsilesional inferior parietal cortex, frontal gyrus,
  supplementary motor area (SMA), and contralesional angular and decreased
  between the ipsilesional M1 and bilateral M1. After the treatment, the FC
  between the ipsilesional M1 and contralesional M1 increased while the FC
  between the ipsilesional M1 and ipsilesional SMA and paracentral lobule
  decreased. A statistically significant correlation was found between the FC
  change in the bilateral M1 and the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) score change.
  CONCLUSION: Our results revealed an abnormal motor network after stroke and
  suggested that the FC could serve as a biomarker of motor function recovery
  in stroke patients with hemiplegia.%

    INTRODUCTION: Stroke can induce large-scale functional reorganization of
  the brain; however, the spatial patterns of this reorganization remain
  largely unknown. METHODS: Using a large (N = 116) sample of participants who
  were in the chronic stages of stroke, we present a systematic study of the
  association between brain damage and functional connectivity within the
  intact hemisphere. We computed correlations between regional cortical damage
  and contralateral functional connectivity. RESULTS: We identified
  left-hemisphere regions that had the most pronounced effect on the
  right-hemisphere functional connectivity, and, conversely, right-hemisphere
  connections where the effect of damage was particularly strong. Notably, the
  vast majority of significant correlations was positive: damage was associated
  with an increase in regional contralateral connectivity. DISCUSSION: These
  findings lend evidence of the reorganization of contralateral cortical
  networks as a response to brain damage, which is more pronounced in a set of
  well-connected regions where connectivity increases with the amount of
  damage.%

    Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible working memory
  but the network mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that
  working memory performance entails brain-wide switching between activity

  healthy controls and individuals with schizophrenia, pharmacological fMRI,
  genetic analyses and network control theory. The stability of states relates
  to dopamine D1 receptor gene expression while state transitions are
  influenced by D2 receptor expression and pharmacological modulation.
  Individuals with schizophrenia show altered network control properties,
  including a more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working
  memory representations. Our results demonstrate the relevance of dopamine
  signaling for the steering of whole-brain network dynamics during working

    \field{abstract}{%
    Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder marked by
  accumulation of extracellular amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) plaques leads to
  progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. Resting-state fMRI
  (RS-fMRI) studies have provided links between these two observations in terms
  of disruption of default mode and task-positive resting-state networks
  (RSNs). Important insights underlying these disruptions were recently
  obtained by investigating dynamic fluctuations in RS-fMRI signals in old
  TG2576 mice (a mouse model of amyloidosis) using a set of quasi-periodic
  patterns (QPP). QPPs represent repeating spatiotemporal patterns of neural
  activity of predefined temporal length. In this article, we used an
  alternative methodology of co-activation patterns (CAPs) that represent
  instantaneous and transient brain configurations that are likely contributors
  to the emergence of commonly observed RSNs and QPPs. We followed a recently
  published approach for obtaining CAPs that divided all time frames, instead
  of those corresponding to supra-threshold activations of a seed region as
  done traditionally, to extract CAPs from RS-fMRI recordings in 10 TG2576
  female mice and eight wild type littermates at 18 months of age.
  Subsequently, we matched the CAPs from the two groups using the Hungarian
  method and compared the temporal (duration, occurrence rate) and the spatial
  (lateralization of significantly co-activated and co-deactivated voxels)
  properties of matched CAPs. We found robust differences in the spatial
  components of matched CAPs. Finally, we used supervised learning to train a
  classifier using either the temporal or the spatial component of CAPs to
  distinguish the transgenic mice from the WT. We found that while duration and
  occurrence rates of all CAPs performed the classification with significantly
  higher accuracy than the chance-level, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
  signals of significantly activated voxels from individual CAPs turned out to
  be a significantly better predictive feature demonstrating a near-perfect
  classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate resting-state co-activation
  patterns are a promising candidate in the development of a diagnostic, and
  potentially, prognostic RS-fMRI biomarker of AD.%

    Clinical depression commonly emerges in adolescence, which is also a time
  of developing cognitive ability and related large-scale functional brain
  networks implicated in depression. In depressed adults, abnormalities in the
  dynamic functioning of frontoinsular networks, in particular, have been
  observed and linked to negative rumination. Thus, network dynamics may
  provide new insight into teen pathophysiology. Here, adolescents (n = 45,
  ages 13-19) with varying severity of depressive symptoms completed a
  resting-state functional MRI scan. Functional networks were evaluated using
  co-activation pattern analysis to identify whole-brain states of spatial
  co-activation that recurred across participants and time. Measures included:
  dwell time (proportion of scan spent in that network state), persistence
  (volume-to-volume maintenance of a network state), and transitions (frequency
  of moving from state A to state B). Analyses tested associations between
  depression or trait rumination and dynamics of network states involving
  frontoinsular and default network systems. Results indicated that adolescents
  showing increased dwell time in, and persistence of, a frontoinsular-default
  network state involving insula, dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex,
  and posterior regions of default network, reported more severe symptoms of
  depression. Further, adolescents who transitioned more frequently between the
  frontoinsular-default state and a prototypical default network state reported
  higher depression. Increased dominance and transition frequency of
  frontoinsular-default network states were also associated with higher
  rumination, and rumination mediated the associations between network dynamics
  and depression. Findings support a model in which abnormal frontoinsular
  dynamics confer vulnerability to maladaptive introspection, which in turn
  contributes to symptoms of adolescent depression.%

    A diverse set of white matter connections supports seamless transitions
  between cognitive states. However, it remains unclear how these connections
  guide the temporal progression of large-scale brain activity patterns in
  different cognitive states. Here, we analyze the brain's trajectories across
  a set of single time point activity patterns from functional magnetic
  resonance imaging data acquired during the resting state and an n-back
  working memory task. We find that specific temporal sequences of brain
  activity are modulated by cognitive load, associated with age, and related to
  task performance. Using diffusion-weighted imaging acquired from the same
  subjects, we apply tools from network control theory to show that linear
  spread of activity along white matter connections constrains the
  probabilities of these sequences at rest, while stimulus-driven visual inputs
  explain the sequences observed during the n-back task. Overall, these results
  elucidate the structural underpinnings of cognitively and developmentally
  relevant spatiotemporal brain dynamics.%

    INTRODUCTION: Recent studies related to assessing functional connectivity
  (FC) in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging have revealed
  that the resulting connectivity patterns exhibit considerable fluctuations
  (dynamic FC [dFC]). A widely applied method for quantifying dFC is the
  sliding window technique. According to this method, the data are divided into
  segments with the same length (window size) and a correlation metric is
  employed to assess the connectivity within these segments, whereby the window
  size is often empirically chosen. METHODS: In this study, we rigorously
  investigate the assessment of dFC using the sliding window approach.
  Specifically, we perform a detailed comparison between different correlation
  metrics, including Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation, Pearson and
  Spearman partial correlation, Mutual Information (MI), Variation of
  Information (VI), Kullback-Leibler divergence, Multiplication of Temporal
  Derivatives and Inverse Covariance. RESULTS: Using test-retest datasets, we
  show that MI and VI yielded the most consistent results by achieving high
  reliability with respect to dFC estimates for different window sizes.
  Subsequent hypothesis testing, based on multivariate phase randomization
  surrogate data generation, allowed the identification of dynamic connections
  between the posterior cingulate cortex and regions in the frontal lobe and
  inferior parietal lobes, which were overall in agreement with previous
  studies. CONCLUSIONS: In the case of MI and VI, a window size of at least 120
  s was found to be necessary for detecting dFC for some of the previously
  identified dynamically connected regions.%

    Acute ischaemic stroke disturbs healthy brain organization, prompting
  subsequent plasticity and reorganization to compensate for the loss of
  specialized neural tissue and function. Static resting state functional MRI
  studies have already furthered our understanding of cerebral reorganization
  by estimating stroke-induced changes in network connectivity aggregated over
  the duration of several minutes. In this study, we used dynamic resting state
  functional MRI analyses to increase temporal resolution to seconds and
  explore transient configurations of motor network connectivity in acute
  stroke. To this end, we collected resting state functional MRI data of 31
  patients with acute ischaemic stroke and 17 age-matched healthy control
  subjects. Stroke patients presented with moderate to severe hand motor
  deficits. By estimating dynamic functional connectivity within a sliding
  window framework, we identified three distinct connectivity configurations of
  motor-related networks. Motor networks were organized into three regional
  domains, i.e. a cortical, subcortical and cerebellar domain. The dynamic
  connectivity patterns of stroke patients diverged from those of healthy
  controls depending on the severity of the initial motor impairment.
  Moderately affected patients (n = 18) spent significantly more time in a
  weakly connected configuration that was characterized by low levels of
  connectivity, both locally as well as between distant regions. In contrast,
  severely affected patients (n = 13) showed a significant preference for
  transitions into a spatially segregated connectivity configuration. This
  configuration featured particularly high levels of local connectivity within
  the three regional domains as well as anti-correlated connectivity between
  distant networks across domains. A third connectivity configuration
  represented an intermediate connectivity pattern compared to the preceding
  two, and predominantly encompassed decreased interhemispheric connectivity
  between cortical motor networks independent of individual deficit severity.
  Alterations within this third configuration thus closely resembled previously
  reported ones originating from static resting state functional MRI studies
  post-stroke. In summary, acute ischaemic stroke not only prompted changes in
  connectivity between distinct networks, but it also caused characteristic
  changes in temporal properties of large-scale network interactions depending
  on the severity of the individual deficit. These findings offer new vistas on
  the dynamic neural mechanisms underlying acute neurological symptoms,
  cortical reorganization and treatment effects in stroke patients.%

    Background and Purpose To explore the whole-brain dynamic functional
  network connectivity patterns in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients and
  their relation to stroke severity in the short and long term. Methods We
  investigated large-scale dynamic functional network connectivity of 41 AIS
  patients two to five days after symptom onset. Re-occurring dynamic
  connectivity configurations were obtained using a sliding window approach and
  k-means clustering. We evaluated differences in dynamic patterns between
  three NIHSS-stroke severity defined groups (mildly, moderately, and severely
  affected patients). Furthermore, we established correlation analyses between
  dynamic connectivity estimates and AIS severity as well as neurological
  recovery within the first 90 days after stroke. Finally, we built Bayesian
  hierarchical models to predict acute ischemic stroke severity and examine the
  inter-relation of dynamic connectivity and clinical measures, with an
  emphasis on white matter hyperintensity lesion load. Results We identified
  three distinct dynamic connectivity configurations in the early post-acute
  stroke phase. More severely affected patients (NIHSS 10-21) spent
  significantly more time in a highly segregated dynamic connectivity
  configuration that was characterized by particularly strong connectivity
  (three-level ANOVA: p<0.05, post hoc t-tests: p<0.05, FDR-corrected for
  multiple comparisons). Recovery, as indexed by the realized change of the
  NIHSS over time, was significantly linked to the acute dynamic connectivity
  between bilateral intraparietal lobule and left angular gyrus (Pearson's
  r=-0.68, p<0.05, FDR-corrected). Increasing dwell times, particularly those
  in a very segregated connectivity configuration, predicted higher acute
  stroke severity in our Bayesian modelling framework. Conclusions Our findings
  demonstrate transiently increased segregation between multiple functional
  domains in case of severe AIS. Dynamic connectivity involving default mode
  network components significantly correlated with recovery in the first three
  months post-stroke.%

    Resting-state functional connectivity is used throughout neuroscience to
  study brain organization and to generate biomarkers of development, disease,
  and cognition. The processes that give rise to correlated activity are,
  however, poorly understood. Here we decompose resting-state functional
  connectivity using a temporal unwrapping procedure to assess the
  contributions of moment-to-moment activity cofluctuations to the overall
  connectivity pattern. This approach temporally resolves functional
  connectivity at a timescale of single frames, which enables us to make direct
  comparisons of cofluctuations of network organization with fluctuations in
  the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series. We show that
  surprisingly, only a small fraction of frames exhibiting the strongest
  cofluctuation amplitude are required to explain a significant fraction of
  variance in the overall pattern of connection weights as well as the
  network's modular structure. These frames coincide with frames of high BOLD
  activity amplitude, corresponding to activity patterns that are remarkably
  consistent across individuals and identify fluctuations in default mode and
  control network activity as the primary driver of resting-state functional
  connectivity. Finally, we demonstrate that cofluctuation amplitude
  synchronizes across subjects during movie watching and that high-amplitude
  frames carry detailed information about individual subjects (whereas
  low-amplitude frames carry little). Our approach reveals fine-scale temporal
  structure of resting-state functional connectivity and discloses that
  frame-wise contributions vary across time. These observations illuminate the
  relation of brain activity to functional connectivity and open a number of
  directions for future research.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Resting-state functional connectivity is typically modeled as the
  correlation structure of whole-brain regional activity. It is studied widely,
  both to gain insight into the brain's intrinsic organization but also to
  develop markers sensitive to changes in an individual's cognitive, clinical,
  and developmental state. Despite this, the origins and drivers of functional
  connectivity, especially at the level of densely sampled individuals, remain
  elusive. Here, we leverage novel methodology to decompose functional
  connectivity into its precise framewise contributions. Using two dense
  sampling datasets, we investigate the origins of individualized functional
  connectivity, focusing specifically on the role of brain network ``events''
  -- short-lived and peaked patterns of high-amplitude cofluctuations. Here, we
  develop a statistical test to identify events in empirical recordings. We
  show that the patterns of cofluctuation expressed during events are repeated
  across multiple scans of the same individual and represent idiosyncratic
  variants of template patterns that are expressed at the group level. Lastly,
  we propose a simple model of functional connectivity based on event
  cofluctuations, demonstrating that group-averaged cofluctuations are
  suboptimal for explaining participant-specific connectivity. Our work
  complements recent studies implicating brief instants of high-amplitude
  cofluctuations as the primary drivers of static, whole-brain functional
  connectivity. Our work also extends those studies, demonstrating that
  cofluctuations during events are individualized, positing a dynamic basis for
  functional connectivity. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have

    To provide an effective substrate for cognitive processes, functional brain
  networks should be able to reorganize and coordinate on a sub-second temporal
  scale. We used magnetoencephalography recordings of spontaneous activity to
  characterize whole-brain functional connectivity dynamics at high temporal
  resolution. Using a novel approach that identifies the points in time at
  which unique patterns of activity recur, we reveal transient (100-200 ms)
  brain states with spatial topographies similar to those of well-known resting
  state networks. By assessing temporal changes in the occurrence of these
  states, we demonstrate that within-network functional connectivity is
  underpinned by coordinated neuronal dynamics that fluctuate much more rapidly
  than has previously been shown. We further evaluate cross-network
  interactions, and show that anticorrelation between the default mode network
  and parietal regions of the dorsal attention network is consistent with an
  inability of the system to transition directly between two transient brain
  states. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01867.001.%

    BACKGROUND: Studies examining the contribution of contralesional brain
  regions to motor recovery after stroke have revealed conflicting results
  comprising both supporting and disturbing influences. Especially the
  relevance of contralesional brain regions beyond primary motor cortex (M1)
  has rarely been studied, particularly concerning the temporal dynamics
  post-stroke. METHODS: We, therefore, used online transcranial magnetic
  stimulation (TMS) interference to longitudinally assess the role of
  contralesional (right) frontoparietal areas for recovery of hand motor
  function after left hemispheric stroke: contralesional M1, contralesional
  dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), and contralesional anterior intraparietal
  sulcus (IPS). Fourteen stroke patients and sixteen age-matched healthy
  subjects performed motor tasks of varying complexity with their (paretic)
  right hand. Motor performance was quantified using three-dimensional
  kinematic data. All patients were assessed twice, (i) in the first week, and
  (ii) after more than three months post-stroke. RESULTS: While we did not
  observe a significant effect of TMS interference on movement kinematics
  following the stimulation of contralesional M1 and dPMC in the first week
  post-stroke, we found improvements of motor performance upon interference
  with contralesional IPS across motor tasks early after stroke, an effect that
  persisted into the later phase. By contrast, for dPMC, TMS-induced
  deterioration of motor performance was only evident three months post-stroke,
  suggesting that a supportive role of contralesional premotor cortex might
  evolve with reorganization. CONCLUSION: We here highlight time-sensitive and
  region-specific effects of contralesional frontoparietal areas after left
  hemisphere stroke, which may influence on neuromodulation regimes aiming at
  supporting recovery of motor function post-stroke.%

    Activity changes in the ipsi- and contralesional parietal cortex and
  abnormal interhemispheric connectivity between these regions are commonly
  observed after stroke, however, their significance for motor recovery remains
  poorly understood. We here assessed the contribution of ipsilesional and
  contralesional anterior intraparietal cortex (aIPS) for hand motor function
  in eighteen recovered chronic stroke patients and eighteen healthy controls
  using a multimodal assessment consisting of resting-state fMRI, motor task
  fMRI, online-rTMS interference, and 3-D movement kinematics. Effects were
  compared against two control stimulation sites, i.e., contralesional M1 and a
  sham stimulation condition. We found that patients with good motor outcome
  compared to patients with more substantial residual deficits featured
  increased resting-state connectivity between ipsilesional aIPS and
  contralesional aIPS as well as between ipsilesional aIPS and dorsal premotor
  cortex. Moreover, interhemispheric connectivity between ipsilesional M1 and
  contralesional M1 as well as ipsilesional aIPS and contralesional M1
  correlated with better motor performance across tasks. TMS interference at
  individual aIPS and M1 coordinates led to differential effects depending on
  the motor task that was tested, i.e., index finger-tapping, rapid pointing
  movements, or a reach-grasp-lift task. Interfering with contralesional aIPS
  deteriorated the accuracy of grasping, especially in patients featuring
  higher connectivity between ipsi- and contralesional aIPS. In contrast,
  interference with the contralesional M1 led to impaired grasping speed in
  patients featuring higher connectivity between bilateral M1. These findings
  suggest differential roles of contralesional M1 and aIPS for distinct aspects
  of recovered hand motor function, depending on the reorganization of
  interhemispheric connectivity.%

    BACKGROUND: Preserved integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST) is a
  marker of good upper-limb behavior and recovery following stroke. However,
  there is less understanding of neural mechanisms that might help facilitate
  upper-limb motor recovery in stroke survivors with extensive CST damage.
  OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate resting state
  functional connectivity in chronic stroke survivors with different levels of
  CST damage and to explore neural correlates of greater upper-limb motor
  performance in stroke survivors with compromised ipsilesional CST integrity.
  METHODS: Thirty chronic stroke survivors (24 males, aged 64.7 $\pm$ 10.8
  years) participated in this study. Three experimental sessions were conducted
  to: 1) obtain anatomical (T1, T2) structural (diffusion) and functional
  (resting state) MRI sequences, 2) determine CST integrity with transcranial
  magnetic stimulation (TMS) and conduct assessments of upper-limb behavior,
  and 3) reconfirm CST integrity status. Participants were divided into groups
  according to the extent of CST damage. Those in the extensive CST damage
  group did not show TMS evoked responses and had significantly lower
  ipsilesional fractional anisotropy. RESULTS: Of the 30 chronic stroke
  survivors, 12 were categorized as having extensive CST damage. Stroke
  survivors with extensive CST damage had weaker functional connectivity in the
  ipsilesional sensorimotor network and greater functional connectivity in the
  ipsilesional fronto-parietal network compared to those with preserved CST
  integrity. For participants with extensive CST damage, improved motor
  performance was associated with greater functional connectivity of the
  ipsilesional fronto-parietal network and higher fractional anisotropy of the
  ipsilesional rostral superior longitudinal fasciculus. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke
  survivors with extensive CST damage have greater resting state functional
  connectivity of an ipsilesional fronto-parietal network that appears to be a
  behaviorally relevant neural mechanism that improves upper-limb motor
  performance.%

    Motor recovery following ischemic stroke is contingent on the ability of
  surviving brain networks to compensate for damaged tissue. In rodent models,
  sensory and motor cortical representations have been shown to remap onto
  intact tissue around the lesion site, but remapping to more distal sites
  (e.g. in the contralesional hemisphere) has also been observed. Resting state
  functional connectivity (FC) analysis has been employed to study compensatory
  network adaptations in humans, but mechanisms and time course of motor
  recovery are not well understood. Here, we examine longitudinal FC in 23
  first-episode ischemic pontine stroke patients and utilize a graph matching
  approach to identify patterns of functional connectivity reorganization
  during recovery. We quantified functional reorganization between several
  intervals ranging from 1 week to 6 months following stroke, and demonstrated
  that the areas that undergo functional reorganization most frequently are in
  cerebellar/subcortical networks. Brain regions with more structural and
  functional connectome disruption due to the stroke also had more remapping
  over time. Finally, we show that functional reorganization is correlated with
  the extent of motor recovery in the early to late subacute phases, and
  furthermore, individuals with greater baseline motor impairment demonstrate
  more extensive early subacute functional reorganization (from one to two
  weeks post-stroke) and this reorganization correlates with better motor
  recovery at 6 months. Taken together, these results suggest that our graph
  matching approach can quantify recovery-relevant, whole-brain functional
  connectivity network reorganization after stroke.%

    The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant
  support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment
  reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and
  evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools
  (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software
  library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration,
  segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric
  analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the
  impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a
  template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of
  three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster
  cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold
  cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually
  labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40
  dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for
  both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results
  indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain
  extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual
  information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic
  mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669$\pm$0.022).
  Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the
  similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data
  and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this
  state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent
  transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated
  effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain
  labeling.%

    Here, we demonstrate that subject motion produces substantial changes in
  the timecourses of resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) data
  despite compensatory spatial registration and regression of motion estimates
  from the data. These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation
  structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many long-distance
  correlations are decreased by subject motion, whereas many short-distance
  correlations are increased. These changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not
  arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional
  connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and
  a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is
  demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a variety of
  software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts
  our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development. These
  results suggest the need for greater care in dealing with subject motion, and
  the need to critically revisit previous rs-fcMRI work that may not have
  adequately controlled for effects of transient subject movements.

    In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an
  automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human
  cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of
  interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34
  cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was
  then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label
  ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater
  reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation
  coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess
  the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs.
  When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate,
  with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance
  error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to
  no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the
  automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex
  into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid
  and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional
  studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed
  at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including
  clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to
  treatment.%

    Connectivity analyses and computational modeling of human brain function
  from fMRI data frequently require the specification of regions of interests
  (ROIs). Several analyses have relied on atlases derived from anatomical or
  cyto-architectonic boundaries to specify these ROIs, yet the suitability of
  atlases for resting state functional connectivity (FC) studies has yet to be
  established. This article introduces a data-driven method for generating an
  ROI atlas by parcellating whole brain resting-state fMRI data into spatially
  coherent regions of homogeneous FC. Several clustering statistics are used to
  compare methodological trade-offs as well as determine an adequate number of
  clusters. Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of the parcellation atlas
  against four ROI atlases (Talairach and Tournoux, Harvard-Oxford,
  Eickoff-Zilles, and Automatic Anatomical Labeling) and a random parcellation
  approach. The evaluated anatomical atlases exhibit poor ROI homogeneity and
  do not accurately reproduce FC patterns present at the voxel scale. In
  general, the proposed functional and random parcellations perform
  equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated. ROI size and hence the number
  of ROIs in a parcellation had the greatest impact on their suitability for FC
  analysis. With 200 or fewer ROIs, the resulting parcellations consist of ROIs
  with anatomic homology, and thus offer increased interpretability.
  Parcellation results containing higher numbers of ROIs (600 or 1,000) most
  accurately represent FC patterns present at the voxel scale and are
  preferable when interpretability can be sacrificed for accuracy. The
  resulting atlases and clustering software have been made publicly available
  at: http://www.nitrc.org/projects/cluster\_roi/.%

    [The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the
  familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point
  out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing
  is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely
  rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent
  to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore,
  in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of
  the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple
  sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery
  rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the
  gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the
  appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.]%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The brainstem is a critical structure that regulates vital autonomic
  functions, houses the cranial nerves and their nuclei, relays motor and
  sensory information between the brain and spinal cord, and modulates
  cognition, mood, and emotions. As a primary relay center, the fiber pathways
  of the brainstem include efferent and afferent connections among the cerebral
  cortex, spinal cord, and cerebellum. While diffusion MRI has been
  successfully applied to map various brain pathways, its application for the
  in vivo imaging of the brainstem pathways has been limited due to inadequate
  resolution and large susceptibility-induced distortion artifacts. With the
  release of high-resolution data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP),
  there is increasing interest in mapping human brainstem pathways. Previous
  works relying on HCP data to study brainstem pathways, however, did not
  consider the prevalence (>80\%) of large distortions in the brainstem even
  after the application of correction procedures from the HCP-Pipeline. They
  were also limited in the lack of adequate consideration of subject
  variability in either fiber pathways or region of interests (ROIs) used for
  bundle reconstruction. To overcome these limitations, we develop in this work
  a probabilistic atlas of 23 major brainstem bundles using high-quality HCP
  data passing rigorous quality control. For the large-scale data from the
  500-Subject release of HCP, we conducted extensive quality controls to
  exclude subjects with severe distortions in the brainstem area. After that,
  we developed a systematic protocol to manually delineate 1300 ROIs on 20 HCP
  subjects (10 males; 10 females) for the reconstruction of fiber bundles using
  tractography techniques. Finally, we leveraged our novel connectome modeling
  techniques including high order fiber orientation distribution (FOD)
  reconstruction from multi-shell diffusion imaging and topography-preserving
  tract filtering algorithms to successfully reconstruct the 23 fiber bundles
  for each subject, which were then used to calculate the probabilistic atlases
  in the MNI152 space for public release. In our experimental results, we
  demonstrate that our method yielded anatomically faithful reconstruction of
  the brainstem pathways and achieved improved performance in comparison with
  an existing atlas of cerebellar peduncles based on HCP data. These atlases
  have been publicly released on NITRIC
  (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/brainstem\_atlas/) and can be readily used by
  brain imaging researchers interested in studying brainstem pathways.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    For the past 25 years, the field of neuroimaging has witnessed the
  development of several software packages for processing multi-parametric
  magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to study the brain. These software
  packages are now routinely used by researchers and clinicians, and have
  contributed to important breakthroughs for the understanding of brain anatomy
  and function. However, no software package exists to process mpMRI data of
  the spinal cord. Despite the numerous clinical needs for such advanced mpMRI
  protocols (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cervical spondylotic
  myelopathy, etc.), researchers have been developing specific tools that,
  while necessary, do not provide an integrative framework that is compatible
  with most usages and that is capable of reaching the community at large. This
  hinders cross-validation and the possibility to perform multi-center studies.
  In this study we introduce the Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT), a comprehensive
  software dedicated to the processing of spinal cord MRI data. SCT builds on
  previously-validated methods and includes state-of-the-art MRI templates and
  atlases of the spinal cord, algorithms to segment and register new data to
  the templates, and motion correction methods for diffusion and functional
  time series. SCT is tailored towards standardization and automation of the
  processing pipeline, versatility, modularity, and it follows guidelines of
  software development and distribution. Preliminary applications of SCT cover
  a variety of studies, from cross-sectional area measures in large databases
  of patients, to the precise quantification of mpMRI metrics in specific
  spinal pathways. We anticipate that SCT will bring together the spinal cord
  neuroimaging community by establishing standard templates and analysis
  procedures.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In 2008, it was proposed that the magnitude of recovery from nonsevere
  upper limb motor impairment over the first 3 to 6 months after stroke,
  measured with the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), is approximately 0.7 times the
  initial impairment (?proportional recovery?). In contrast to patients with
  nonsevere hemiparesis, about 30\% of patients with an initial severe paresis
  do not show such recovery (?nonrecoverers?). Hence it was suggested that the
  proportional recovery rule (PRR) was a manifestation of a spontaneous
  mechanism that is present in all patients with mild-to-moderate paresis but
  only in some with severe paresis. Since the introduction of the PRR, it has
  subsequently been applied to other motor and nonmotor impairments. This more
  general investigation of the PRR has led to inconsistencies in its
  formulation and application, making it difficult to draw conclusions across
  studies and precipitating some cogent criticism. Here, we conduct a detailed
  comparison of the different studies reporting proportional recovery and,
  where appropriate, critique statistical methodology. On balance, we conclude
  that existing data in aggregate are largely consistent with the PRR as a
  population-level model for upper limb motor recovery; recent reports of its
  demise are exaggerated, as these excessively focus on the less conclusive
  issue of individual subject-level predictions. Moving forward, we suggest
  that methodological caution and new analytical approaches will be needed to
  confirm (or refute) a systematic character to spontaneous recovery from motor
  and other poststroke impairments, which can be captured by a mathematical
  rule either at the population or at the subject level.%

    The proportional recovery rule asserts that most stroke survivors recover a
  fixed proportion of lost function. To the extent that this is true, recovery
  from stroke can be predicted accurately from baseline measures of acute
  post-stroke impairment alone. Reports that baseline scores explain more than
  80\%, and sometimes more than 90\%, of the variance in the patients'
  recoveries, are rapidly accumulating. Here, we show that these headline
  effect sizes are likely inflated. The key effects in this literature are
  typically expressed as, or reducible to, correlation coefficients between
  baseline scores and recovery (outcome scores minus baseline scores). Using
  formal analyses and simulations, we show that these correlations will be
  extreme when outcomes are significantly less variable than baselines, which
  they often will be in practice regardless of the real relationship between
  outcomes and baselines. We show that these effect sizes are likely to be
  over-optimistic in every empirical study that we found that reported enough
  information for us to make the judgement, and argue that the same is likely
  to be true in other studies as well. The implication is that recovery after
  stroke may not be as proportional as recent studies suggest.%

    Stroke is the second leading cause of death and a major cause of disability
  worldwide. Its incidence is increasing because the population ages. In
  addition, more young people are affected by stroke in low- and middle-income
  countries. Ischemic stroke is more frequent but hemorrhagic stroke is
  responsible for more deaths and disability-adjusted life-years lost.
  Incidence and mortality of stroke differ between countries, geographical

    The magnitude of disability among elderly stroke survivors is substantial.
  There have been few community-based estimates of the contribution gender and
  older age make to stroke-related disability and outcome. Using the original
  Framingham Study cohort, we documented gender-specific neurological deficits
  and disability differences in stroke survivors at six months post-stroke.
  Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios,
  comparing men and women, and adjusting for age, and age and stroke subtype.
  Age and gender-matched controls were then compared to distinguish
  stroke-related disability from disability associated with general aging.
  Results showed that almost half (43\%) of all elderly stroke survivors in the
  cohort had moderate to severe neurological deficits. In the crude analyses,
  women were more dependent in ADLs (33.9\% vs 15.6\%), less likely to walk
  unassisted (40.3\% vs 17.8\%), and living in nursing homes (34.9 \% vs
  13.3\%). After adjusting for age and stroke subtype, it was older age that
  accounted for the severity of disability. When compared to age and
  gender-matched controls, stroke cases were significantly more disabled in all
  domains studied. In this elderly cohort, more women experienced initial
  strokes and were more disabled at 6 months post-stroke than men. However,
  older age at stroke onset, not gender or stroke subtype, was associated with
  greater disability. Health care providers need to understand that strokes
  occur later in life for women and that because of age, women are at greater
  risk for disability and institutionalization.%

    Stroke ranks among the leading causes for morbidity and mortality
  worldwide. New and continuously improving treatment options such as
  thrombolysis and thrombectomy have revolutionized acute stroke treatment in
  recent years. Following modern rhythms, the next revolution might well be the
  strategic use of the steadily increasing amounts of patient-related data for
  generating models enabling individualized outcome predictions. Milestones
  have already been achieved in several health care domains, as big data and
  artificial intelligence have entered everyday life. The aim of this review is
  to synoptically illustrate and discuss how artificial intelligence approaches
  may help to compute single-patient predictions in stroke outcome research in
  the acute, subacute and chronic stage. We will present approaches considering
  demographic, clinical and electrophysiological data, as well as data
  originating from various imaging modalities and combinations thereof. We will
  outline their advantages, disadvantages, their potential pitfalls and the
  promises they hold with a special focus on a clinical audience. Throughout
  the review we will highlight methodological aspects of novel machine-learning
  approaches as they are particularly crucial to realize precision medicine. We
  will finally provide an outlook on how artificial intelligence approaches
  might contribute to enhancing favourable outcomes after stroke.%

    The most difficult clinical questions in stroke rehabilitation are ``What
  is this patient's potential for recovery?'' and ``What is the best
  rehabilitation strategy for this person, given her/his clinical profile?''
  Without answers to these questions, clinicians struggle to make decisions
  regarding the content and focus of therapy, and researchers design studies
  that inadvertently mix participants who have a high likelihood of responding
  with those who do not. Developing and implementing biomarkers that
  distinguish patient subgroups will help address these issues and unravel the
  factors important to the recovery process. The goal of the present paper is
  to provide a consensus statement regarding the current state of the evidence
  for stroke recovery biomarkers. Biomarkers of motor, somatosensory, cognitive
  and language domains across the recovery timeline post-stroke are considered;
  with focus on brain structure and function, and exclusion of blood markers
  and genetics. We provide evidence for biomarkers that are considered ready to
  be included in clinical trials, as well as others that are promising but not
  ready and so represent a developmental priority. We conclude with an example
  that illustrates the utility of biomarkers in recovery and rehabilitation
  research, demonstrating how the inclusion of a biomarker may enhance future
  clinical trials. In this way, we propose a way forward for when and where we
  can include biomarkers to advance the efficacy of the practice of, and
  research into, rehabilitation and recovery after stroke.%

    Background. Accurate prediction of clinical impairment in upper-extremity
  motor function following therapy in chronic stroke patients is a difficult
  task for clinicians but is key in prescribing appropriate therapeutic
  strategies. Machine learning is a highly promising avenue with which to
  improve prediction accuracy in clinical practice. Objectives. The objective
  was to evaluate the performance of 5 machine learning methods in predicting
  postintervention upper-extremity motor impairment in chronic stroke patients
  using demographic, clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging input variables.
  Methods. A total of 102 patients (female: 31\%, age 61 $\pm$ 11 years) were
  included. The upper-extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UE-FMA) was used to
  assess motor impairment of the upper limb before and after intervention.
  Elastic net (EN), support vector machines, artificial neural networks,
  classification and regression trees, and random forest were used to predict
  postintervention UE-FMA. The performances of methods were compared using
  cross-validated R2. Results. EN performed significantly better than other
  methods in predicting postintervention UE-FMA using demographic and baseline
  clinical data (median R EN 2 = 0 . 91 , R RF 2 = 0 . 88 , R ANN 2 = 0 . 83 ,
  R SVM 2 = 0 . 79 , R CART 2 = 0 . 70 ; P < .05). Preintervention UE-FMA and
  the difference in motor threshold (MT) between the affected and unaffected
  hemispheres were the strongest predictors. The difference in MT had greater
  importance than the absence or presence of a motor-evoked potential (MEP) in
  the affected hemisphere. Conclusion. Machine learning methods may enable
  clinicians to accurately predict a chronic stroke patient's postintervention
  UE-FMA. Interhemispheric difference in the MT is an important predictor of
  chronic stroke patients' response to therapy and, therefore, could be
  included in prospective studies.%

    In this study, models based on quantitative imaging biomarkers of
  post-stroke structural connectome disruption were used to predict six-month
  outcomes in various domains. Demographic information and clinical MRIs were
  collected from 40 ischemic stroke subjects (age: 68.1 $\pm$ 13.2 years, 17
  female, NIHSS: 6.8 $\pm$ 5.6). Diffusion-weighted images were used to create
  lesion masks, which were uploaded to the Network Modification (NeMo) Tool.
  The NeMo Tool, using only clinical MRIs, allows estimation of connectome
  disruption at three levels: whole brain, individual gray matter regions and
  between pairs of gray matter regions. Partial Least Squares Regression models
  were constructed for each level of connectome disruption and for each of the
  three six-month outcomes: applied cognitive, basic mobility and daily
  activity. Models based on lesion volume were created for comparison.
  Cross-validation, bootstrapping and multiple comparisons corrections were
  implemented to minimize over-fitting and Type I errors. The regional
  disconnection model best predicted applied cognitive (R(2) = 0.56) and basic
  mobility outcomes (R(2) = 0.70), while the pairwise disconnection model best
  predicted the daily activity measure (R(2) = 0.72). These results demonstrate
  that models based on connectome disruption metrics were more accurate than
  ones based on lesion volume and that increasing anatomical specificity of
  disconnection metrics does not always increase model accuracy, likely due to
  statistical adjustments for concomitant increases in data dimensionality.
  This work establishes that the NeMo Tool's measures of baseline connectome
  disruption, acquired using only routinely collected MRI scans, can predict
  6-month post-stroke outcomes in various functional domains including
  cognition, motor function and daily activities. Hum Brain Mapp, 2016.

    Behavioural deficits in stroke reflect both structural damage at the site
  of injury, and widespread network dysfunction caused by structural,
  functional, and metabolic disconnection. Two recent methods allow for the
  estimation of structural and functional disconnection from clinical
  structural imaging. This is achieved by embedding a patient's lesion into an
  atlas of functional and structural connections in healthy subjects, and
  deriving the ensemble of structural and functional connections that pass
  through the lesion, thus indirectly estimating its impact on the whole brain
  connectome. This indirect assessment of network dysfunction is more readily
  available than direct measures of functional and structural connectivity
  obtained with functional and diffusion MRI, respectively, and it is in theory
  applicable to a wide variety of disorders. To validate the clinical relevance
  of these methods, we quantified the prediction of behavioural deficits in a
  prospective cohort of 132 first-time stroke patients studied at 2 weeks
  post-injury (mean age 52.8 years, range 22-77; 63 females; 64 right
  hemispheres). Specifically, we used multivariate ridge regression to relate
  deficits in multiple functional domains (left and right visual, left and
  right motor, language, spatial attention, spatial and verbal memory) with the
  pattern of lesion and indirect structural or functional disconnection. In a
  subgroup of patients, we also measured direct alterations of functional
  connectivity with resting-state functional MRI. Both lesion and indirect
  structural disconnection maps were predictive of behavioural impairment in
  all domains (0.16 < R2 < 0.58) except for verbal memory (0.05 < R2 < 0.06).
  Prediction from indirect functional disconnection was scarce or negligible
  (0.01 < R2 < 0.18) except for the right visual field deficits (R2 = 0.38),
  even though multivariate maps were anatomically plausible in all domains.
  Prediction from direct measures of functional MRI functional connectivity in
  a subset of patients was clearly superior to indirect functional
  disconnection. In conclusion, the indirect estimation of structural
  connectivity damage successfully predicted behavioural deficits post-stroke
  to a level comparable to lesion information. However, indirect estimation of
  functional disconnection did not predict behavioural deficits, nor was a
  substitute for direct functional connectivity measurements, especially for
  cognitive disorders.%

    Clinicians and scientists alike have long sought to predict the course and
  severity of chronic post-stroke cognitive and motor outcomes, as the ability
  to do so would inform treatment and rehabilitation strategies. However, it
  remains difficult to make accurate predictions about chronic post-stroke
  outcomes due, in large part, to high inter-individual variability in recovery
  and a reliance on clinical heuristics rather than empirical methods. The
  neuroanatomical location of a stroke is a key variable associated with
  long-term outcomes, and because lesion location can be derived from routinely
  collected clinical neuroimaging data there is an opportunity to use this
  information to make empirically based predictions about post-stroke deficits.
  For example, lesion location can be compared to statistically weighted
  multivariate lesion-behavior maps (LBMs) of neuroanatomical regions that,
  when damaged, are associated with specific deficits based on aggregated
  outcome data from large cohorts. Here, our goal was to evaluate whether we
  can leverage LBMs based on data from two large cohorts of individuals with
  focal brain lesions to make predictions of 12-month cognitive and motor
  outcomes in an independent sample of stroke patients. Further, we evaluated
  whether we could augment these predictions by estimating the structural and
  functional networks disrupted in association with each LBM through the use of
  structural and functional lesion network mapping (sLNM \& fLNM,
  respectively), which use normative structural and functional connectivity
  data from neurologically healthy individuals to elucidate lesion-associated
  networks. We derived these brain network maps using the anatomical regions
  with the strongest association with impairment for each cognitive and motor
  outcome based on LBM results. These peak regional findings became the 'seeds'
  to generate networks, an approach that offers potentially greater precision
  compared to previously used single-lesion approaches. Next, in an independent
  sample, we quantified the overlap of each lesion location with the LBM, sLNM,
  and fLNM and evaluated how much variance each could explain in 12-month
  behavioral outcomes using a latent growth curve statistical model. We found
  that each lesion-deficit mapping modality was able to predict a statistically
  significant amount of variance in cognitive and motor outcomes. Both fLNM and
  sLNM were able to predict variance in 12-month outcomes beyond LBM. fLNM
  performed best for the prediction of language deficits, and sLNM performed
  best for the prediction of motor deficits. Altogether, these results support
  the notion that lesion location and lesion network mapping can be combined to
  improve the prediction of post-stroke deficits at 12-months.%

    BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown motor impairment after
  a stroke relates to lesion size and location, but unexplained variability in
  recovery still exists. In this study, we used lesion-mapping techniques in
  combination with diffusion tensor imaging to quantitatively test the
  hypothesis that motor recovery in patients with chronic stroke is inversely
  related to the proportion of the corticospinal tract (CST) affected by the
  lesion. METHODS: We studied 50 patients with chronic stroke, all of whom
  presented with moderate to severe motor impairments in the acute stage, using
  high-resolution anatomic MRI. We evaluated the degree of motor impairment
  with the Upper Extremity module of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment. To analyze the
  relationship between CST damage and impairment scores, we calculated a
  CST-lesion load for each patient by overlaying the patient's lesion map with
  a probabilistic tract derived from diffusion tensor images of age-matched
  healthy subjects. RESULTS: CST-lesion load was a significant predictor of
  motor deficit. Infarct size, despite correlating with motor scores, did not
  significantly predict impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the degree of
  functional motor deficit after a stroke is highly dependent on the overlap of
  the lesion with the CST and not lesion size per se. In the future, automated
  calculation of CST-lesion load may allow more precise prediction of motor
  impairment after stroke.%

    OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to investigate whether an imaging
  measure of corticospinal tract (CST) injury in the acute phase can predict
  motor outcome at 3 months in comparison to clinical assessment of initial
  motor impairment. METHODS: A two-site prospective cohort study followed up a
  group of first-ever ischemic stroke patients using the Upper-Extremity
  Fugl-Meyer (UE-FM) Scale to measure motor impairment in the acute phase and
  at 3 months. A weighted CST lesion load (wCST-LL) was calculated by
  overlaying the patient's lesion map on magnetic resonance imaging with a
  probabilistic CST constructed from healthy control subjects. Regression
  models were fit to assess the predictive value of wCST-LL and compared with
  initial motor impairment. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (37 from cohort 1 and
  39 from cohort 2) completed the study. wCST-LL as well as assessment of motor
  impairment (UE-FM) in the acute phase correlated with motor impairment
  (UE-FM) at 3 months in both cohort 1 (R(2) = 0.69 vs. R(2) = 0.67; p = 0.43)
  and cohort 2 (R(2) = 0.69 vs. R(2) = 0.62; p = 0.25). In the severely
  impaired subgroup (defined as UE-FM $\leq$ 10 at baseline), wCST-LL
  correlated with outcomes significantly better than clinical assessment (R(2)
  = 0.47 vs. R(2) = 0.11; p = 0.03). In the nonseverely impaired subgroup,
  stroke patients recovered approximately 70\% of their maximal recovery
  potential. All stroke patients in both cohorts had poor motor outcomes at 3
  months (defined as UE-FM $\leq$ 25) when wCST-LL was $\geq$ 7.0 cc (positive
  predictive value was 100\%). INTERPRETATION: wCST-LL, an imaging biomarker
  determined in the acute phase, can predict poststroke motor outcomes at 3
  months, especially in patients with severe impairment at baseline.%

    Background. Corticospinal tract (CST) damage is considered a biomarker for
  stroke recovery. Several methods have been used to define CST damage and
  examine its relationship to motor performance, but which method is most
  useful remains unclear. Proprioceptive impairment also affects stroke
  recovery and may be related to CST damage. Methods. Robotic assessment
  quantified upper-limb motor and proprioceptive performance at 2 weeks and 6
  months poststroke (n = 149). Three previously-established CST lesion metrics
  were calculated using clinical neuroimaging. Diffusion magnetic resonance
  imaging quantified CST microstructure in a subset of participants (n = 21).
  Statistical region of interest (sROI) analysis identified lesion locations
  associated with motor and proprioceptive deficits. Results. CST lesion
  metrics were moderately correlated with motor scores at 2 weeks and 6 months
  poststroke. CST fractional anisotropy (FA) was correlated with motor scores
  at 1 month poststroke, but not at 6 months. The FA ratio of the posterior
  limb of the internal capsule was not correlated with motor performance. CST
  lesion metrics were moderately correlated with proprioceptive scores at 2
  weeks and 6 months poststroke. sROI analysis confirmed that CST damage was
  associated with motor and proprioceptive deficits and additionally found that
  putamen, internal capsule, and corticopontocerebellar tract lesions were
  associated with poor motor performance. Conclusions. Across all methods used
  to quantify CST damage, correlations with motor or proprioceptive performance
  were moderate at best. Future research is needed to identify complementary or
  alternative biomarkers to address the complexity and heterogeneity of stroke
  recovery.%

    Biomarkers that represent the structural and functional integrity of the
  motor system enable us to better assess motor outcome post-stroke. The degree
  of overlap between the stroke lesion and corticospinal tract (CST Injury) is
  a measure of the structural integrity of the motor system, whereas the
  left-to-right motor cortex resting state connectivity (LM1-RM1
  rs-connectivity) is a measure of its functional integrity. CST Injury and
  LM1-RM1 rs-connectivity each individually correlate with motor outcome
  post-stroke, but less is understood about the relationship between these
  biomarkers. Thus, this study investigates the relationship between CST Injury
  and LM1-RM1 rs-connectivity, individually and together, with motor outcome.
  Twenty-seven participants with upper limb motor deficits post-stroke
  completed motor assessments and underwent MRI at one time point. CST Injury
  and LM1-RM1 rs-connectivity were derived from T1-weighted and resting state
  functional MRI scans, respectively. We performed hierarchical multiple
  regression analyses to determine the contribution of each biomarker in
  explaining motor outcome. The interaction between CST Injury and LM1-RM1
  rs-connectivity does not significantly contribute to the variability in motor
  outcome. However, inclusion of both CST Injury and LM1-RM1 rs-connectivity
  explains more variability in motor outcome, than either alone. We suggest
  both biomarkers provide distinct information about an individual's motor
  outcome.%

    BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Infarct size on T2-weighted MRI correlates only
  modestly with outcome, particularly for small strokes. This may be largely
  because of differences in the locations of infarcts and consequently in the
  functional pathways that are damaged. To test this hypothesis quantitatively,
  we developed a ``mask'' of the corticospinal pathway to determine whether the
  extent of stroke intersection with the pathway would be more closely related
  to clinical motor deficit and axonal injury in the descending motor pathways
  than total stroke lesion volume. METHODS: Eighteen patients were studied > or
  =1 month after first ischemic stroke that caused a motor deficit by use of
  brain T2-weighted imaging, MR spectroscopic (MRS) measurements of the
  neuronal marker compound N-acetyl aspartate in the posterior limb of the
  internal capsule, and motor impairment and disability measures. A
  corticospinal mask based on neuroanatomic landmarks was generated from a
  subset of the MRI data. The maximum proportion of the cross-sectional area of
  this mask occupied by stroke was determined for each patient after all brain
  images were transformed into a common stereotaxic brain space. RESULTS: There
  was a significant linear relationship between the maximum proportional
  cross-sectional area of the corticospinal mask occupied by stroke and motor
  deficit (r(2)=0.82, P<0.001), whereas the relationship between the total
  stroke volume and motor deficit was better described by a cubic curve
  (r(2)=0.76, P<0.001). Inspection of the data plots showed that the total
  stroke volume discriminated poorly between smaller strokes with regard to the
  extent of associated motor deficit, whereas the maximum proportion of the
  mask cross-sectional area occupied by stroke appeared to be a more
  discriminatory marker of motor deficit and also N-acetyl aspartate reduction.
  CONCLUSIONS: Segmentation of functional motor pathways on MRI allows
  estimation of the extent of damage specifically to that pathway by the stroke
  lesion. The extent of stroke intersection with the motor pathways was more
  linearly related to the magnitude of motor deficit than total lesion volume
  and appeared to be a better discriminator between small strokes with regard
  to motor deficit. This emphasizes the importance of the anatomic relationship
  of the infarct to local structures in determining functional impairment.
  Prospective studies are necessary to assess whether this approach would allow
  improved early estimation of prognosis after stroke.%

    Background There is growing interest to establish recovery biomarkers,
  especially neurological biomarkers, in order to develop new therapies and
  prediction models for the promotion of stroke rehabilitation and recovery.
  However, there is no consensus among the neurorehabilitation community about
  which biomarker(s) have the highest predictive value for motor recovery.
  Objective To review the evidence and determine which neurological
  biomarker(s) meet the high evidence quality criteria for use in predicting
  motor recovery. Methods We searched databases for prognostic
  neuroimaging/neurophysiological studies. Methodological quality of each study
  was assessed using a previously employed comprehensive 15-item rating system.
  Furthermore, we used the GRADE approach and ranked the overall evidence
  quality for each category of neurologic biomarker. Results Seventy-one
  articles met our inclusion criteria; 5 categories of neurologic biomarkers
  were identified: diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), transcranial magnetic
  stimulation (TMS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), conventional
  structural MRI (sMRI), and a combination of these biomarkers. Most studies
  were conducted with individuals after ischemic stroke in the acute and/or
  subacute stage (~70\%). Less than one-third of the studies (21/71) were
  assessed with satisfactory methodological quality (80\% or more of total
  quality score). Conventional structural MRI and the combination biomarker
  categories ranked ``high'' in overall evidence quality. Conclusions There
  were 3 prevalent methodological limitations: (a) lack of cross-validation,
  (b) lack of minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for motor
  outcomes, and (c) small sample size. More high-quality studies are needed to
  establish which neurological biomarkers are the best predictors of motor
  recovery after stroke. Finally, the quarter-century old methodological
  quality tool used here should be updated by inclusion of more contemporary
  methods and statistical approaches.%

    BACKGROUND: Motor deficit after stroke is related to regional anatomical
  damage. OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of lesion location on upper limb
  motor deficit in chronic patients with stroke. METHODS: Lesion likelihood
  maps were created from T1-weighted structural MRI in 33 chronic patients with
  stroke with either purely subcortical lesions (SC, n=19) or lesions extending
  to any of the cortical motor areas (CM, n=14). We estimated lesion likelihood
  maps over the whole brain and applied multivoxel pattern analysis to seek the
  contribution weight of lesion likelihood to upper limb motor deficit. Among 5
  brain regions of interest, the brain region with the greatest contribution to
  motor deficit was determined for each subgroup. RESULTS: The corticospinal
  tract was most likely to be damaged in both subgroups. However, while damage
  in the corticospinal tract was the best indicator of motor deficit in the SC
  patients, motor deficit in the CM patients was best explained by damage in
  brain areas activated during handgrip. CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of
  structural damage can add to models explaining motor outcome after stroke,
  but assessment of corticospinal tract damage alone is unlikely to be
  sufficient when considering patients with stroke with a wide range of lesion
  topography.%

    Lesion load of the corticospinal tract (CST-LL), a measure of overlap
  between a stroke lesion and the CST, is one of the strongest predictors of
  motor outcomes following stroke. CST-LL is typically calculated by using a
  probabilistic map of the CST originating from the primary motor cortex (M1).
  However, higher order motor areas also have projections that contribute to
  the CST and motor control. In this retrospective study, we examined whether
  evaluating CST-LL from additional motor origins is more strongly associated
  with post-stroke motor severity than using CST-LL originating from M1 only.
  We found that lesion load to both the ventral premotor (PMv) cortex and M1
  were more strongly related to stroke motor severity indexed by Fugl-Meyer
  Assessment cut-off scores than CST-LL of M1 alone, suggesting that higher

    Clinical research based on neuroimaging data has benefited from machine
  learning methods, which have the ability to provide individualized
  predictions and to account for the interaction among units of information in
  the brain. Application of machine learning in structural imaging to
  investigate diseases that involve brain injury presents an additional
  challenge, especially in conditions like stroke, due to the high variability
  across patients regarding characteristics of the lesions. Extracting data
  from anatomical images in a way that translates brain damage information into
  features to be used as input to learning algorithms is still an open
  question. One of the most common approaches to capture regional information
  from brain injury is to obtain the lesion load per region (i.e. the
  proportion of voxels in anatomical structures that are considered to be
  damaged). However, no systematic evaluation has yet been performed to compare
  this approach with using patterns of voxels (i.e. considering each voxel as a
  single feature). In this paper we compared both approaches applying Gaussian
  Process Regression to decode motor scores in 50 chronic stroke patients based
  solely on data derived from structural MRI. For both approaches we compared
  different ways to delimit anatomical areas: regions of interest from an
  anatomical atlas, the corticospinal tract, a mask obtained from fMRI analysis
  with a motor task in healthy controls and regions selected using
  lesion-symptom mapping. Our analysis showed that extracting features through
  patterns of voxels that represent lesion probability produced better results
  than quantifying the lesion load per region. In particular, from the
  different ways to delimit anatomical areas compared, the best performance was
  obtained with a combination of a range of cortical and subcortical motor
  areas as well as the corticospinal tract. These results will inform the
  appropriate methodology for predicting long term motor outcomes from early
  post-stroke structural brain imaging.%

    Background The ability to predict outcome after stroke is clinically
  important for planning treatment and for stratification in restorative
  clinical trials. In relation to the upper limbs, the main predictor of
  outcome is initial severity, with patients who present with mild to moderate
  impairment regaining about 70\% of their initial impairment by 3 months
  post-stroke. However, in those with severe presentations, this proportional
  recovery applies in only about half, with the other half experiencing poor
  recovery. The reasons for this failure to recover are not established
  although the extent of corticospinal tract damage is suggested to be a
  contributory factor. In this study, we investigated 30 patients with chronic
  stroke who had presented with severe upper limb impairment and asked whether
  it was possible to differentiate those with a subsequent good or poor
  recovery of the upper limb based solely on a T1-weighted structural brain
  scan. Methods A support vector machine approach using voxel-wise lesion
  likelihood values was used to show that it was possible to classify patients
  as good or poor recoverers with variable accuracy depending on which brain
  regions were used to perform the classification. Results While considering
  damage within a corticospinal tract mask resulted in 73\% classification
  accuracy, using other (non-corticospinal tract) motor areas provided 87\%
  accuracy, and combining both resulted in 90\% accuracy. Conclusion This proof
  of concept approach highlights the relative importance of different
  anatomical structures in supporting post-stroke upper limb motor recovery and
  points towards methodologies that might be used to stratify patients in
  future restorative clinical trials.%

    BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aside from the primary motor cortex, the
  corticospinal tract (CST) also receives fibers from dorsal and ventral
  premotor cortices and supplementary motor area, all of which might
  potentially contribute to motor function after stroke. We sought to quantify
  the microstructural integrity of CST originating from the hand
  representations in these 4 motor cortices separately and examined how these
  values related to hand motor impairment. METHODS: Probabilistic tractography
  from functional MRI-defined cortical sites demonstrated continuous CST
  originating from hand representations within each motor area in a group of
  healthy subjects. Microstructural integrity for each tract was calculated
  using fractional anisotropy at the level of the posterior limb of the
  internal capsule in a group of patients with chronic stroke. RESULTS:
  Fractional anisotropy was reduced in all 4 CSTs in the affected hemisphere.
  Grip strength correlated with the integrity of the CSTs originating from
  primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices, whereas, in a multiple regression
  model, the latter improved the ability of primary motor cortex CST to explain
  variability in grip strength. CONCLUSION: Handgrip critically depends on the
  CST originating in primary motor cortex but microstructural integrity of CST
  originating from premotor cortices appears to play a role in supporting motor
  function after stroke.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Our knowledge of the anatomical organization of the human brain in health
  and disease draws heavily on the study of patients with focal brain lesions.
  Historically the first method of mapping brain function, it is still
  potentially the most powerful, establishing the necessity of any putative
  neural substrate for a given function or deficit. Great inferential power,
  however, carries a crucial vulnerability: without stronger alternatives any
  consistent error cannot be easily detected. A hitherto unexamined source of
  such error is the structure of the high-dimensional distribution of patterns
  of focal damage, especially in ischaemic injury-the commonest aetiology in
  lesion-deficit studies-where the anatomy is naturally shaped by the
  architecture of the vascular tree. This distribution is so complex that
  analysis of lesion data sets of conventional size cannot illuminate its
  structure, leaving us in the dark about the presence or absence of such
  error. To examine this crucial question we assembled the largest known set of
  focal brain lesions (n = 581), derived from unselected patients with acute
  ischaemic injury (mean age = 62.3 years, standard deviation = 17.8,
  male:female ratio = 0.547), visualized with diffusion-weighted magnetic
  resonance imaging, and processed with validated automated lesion segmentation
  routines. High-dimensional analysis of this data revealed a hidden bias
  within the multivariate patterns of damage that will consistently distort
  lesion-deficit maps, displacing inferred critical regions from their true
  locations, in a manner opaque to replication. Quantifying the size of this
  mislocalization demonstrates that past lesion-deficit relationships estimated
  with conventional inferential methodology are likely to be significantly
  displaced, by a magnitude dependent on the unknown underlying lesion-deficit
  relationship itself. Past studies therefore cannot be retrospectively
  corrected, except by new knowledge that would render them redundant.
  Positively, we show that novel machine learning techniques employing
  high-dimensional inference can nonetheless accurately converge on the true
  locus. We conclude that current inferences about human brain function and
  deficits based on lesion mapping must be re-evaluated with methodology that
  adequately captures the high-dimensional structure of lesion data.%

    In the 20th century, many advances in biological knowledge and
  evidence-based medicine were supported by p values and accompanying methods.
  In the early 21st century, ambitions toward precision medicine place a
  premium on detailed predictions for single individuals. The shift causes
  tension between traditional regression methods used to infer statistically
  significant group differences and burgeoning predictive analysis tools suited
  to forecast an individual's future. Our comparison applies linear models for
  identifying significant contributing variables and for finding the most
  predictive variable sets. In systematic data simulations and common medical
  datasets, we explored how variables identified as significantly relevant and
  variables identified as predictively relevant can agree or diverge. Across
  analysis scenarios, even small predictive performances typically coincided
  with finding underlying significant statistical relationships, but not vice
  versa. More complete understanding of different ways to define ``important''
  associations is a prerequisite for reproducible research and advances toward
  personalizing medical care.%

    Lesion symptom mapping (LSM) tools are used on brain injury data to
  identify the neural structures critical for a given behavior or symptom.
  Univariate lesion symptom mapping (ULSM) methods provide statistical
  comparisons of behavioral test scores in patients with and without a lesion
  on a voxel by voxel basis. More recently, multivariate lesion symptom mapping
  (MLSM) methods have been developed that consider the effects of all lesioned
  voxels in one model simultaneously. In the current study, we provide a
  much-needed systematic comparison of several ULSM and MLSM methods, using
  both synthetic and real data to identify the potential strengths and
  weaknesses of both approaches. We tested the spatial precision of each LSM
  method for both single and dual (network type) anatomical target simulations
  across anatomical target location, sample size, noise level, and lesion
  smoothing. Additionally, we performed false positive simulations to identify
  the characteristics associated with each method's spurious findings.
  Simulations showed no clear superiority of either ULSM or MLSM methods
  overall, but rather highlighted specific advantages of different methods. No
  single method produced a thresholded LSM map that exclusively delineated
  brain regions associated with the target behavior. Thus, different LSM
  methods are indicated, depending on the particular study design, specific
  hypotheses, and sample size. Overall, we recommend the use of both ULSM and
  MLSM methods in tandem to enhance confidence in the results: Brain foci
  identified as significant across both types of methods are unlikely to be
  spurious and can be confidently reported as robust results.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Lesion analysis is a classic approach to study brain functions. Because
  brain function is a result of coherent activations of a collection of
  functionally related voxels, lesion-symptom relations are generally
  contributed by multiple voxels simultaneously. Although voxel-based
  lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) has made substantial contributions to the
  understanding of brain-behavior relationships, a better understanding of the
  brain-behavior relationship contributed by multiple brain regions needs a
  multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (MLSM). The purpose of this artilce was
  to develop an MLSM using a machine learning-based multivariate regression
  algorithm: support vector regression (SVR). In the proposed SVR-LSM, the
  symptom relation to the entire lesion map as opposed to each isolated voxel
  is modeled using a nonlinear function, so the intervoxel correlations are
  intrinsically considered, resulting in a potentially more sensitive way to
  examine lesion-symptom relationships. To explore the relative merits of VLSM
  and SVR-LSM we used both approaches in the analysis of a synthetic dataset.
  SVR-LSM showed much higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting the
  synthetic lesion-behavior relations than VLSM. When applied to lesion data
  and language measures from patients with brain damages, SVR-LSM reproduced
  the essential pattern of previous findings identified by VLSM and showed
  higher sensitivity than VLSM for identifying the lesion-behavior relations.
  Our data also showed the possibility of using lesion data to predict
  continuous behavior scores.%

    Multivariate lesion behaviour mapping based on machine learning algorithms
  has recently been suggested to complement the methods of anatomo-behavioural
  approaches in cognitive neuroscience. Several studies applied and validated
  support vector regression-based lesion symptom mapping (SVR-LSM) to map
  anatomo-behavioural relations. However, this promising method, as well as the
  multivariate approach per se, still bears many open questions. By using large
  lesion samples in three simulation experiments, the present study empirically
  tested the validity of several methodological aspects. We found that (i)
  correction for multiple comparisons is required in the current implementation
  of SVR-LSM, (ii) that sample sizes of at least 100-120 subjects are required
  to optimally model voxel-wise lesion location in SVR-LSM, and (iii) that
  SVR-LSM is susceptible to misplacement of statistical topographies along the
  brain's vasculature to a similar extent as mass-univariate analyses.%

    In vivo tracking of white matter fibres catalysed a modern perspective on
  the pivotal role of brain connectome disruption in neuropsychological
  deficits. However, the examination of white matter integrity in neurological
  patients by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging bears conceptual
  limitations and is not widely applicable, as it requires imaging-compatible
  patients and resources beyond the capabilities of many researchers. The
  indirect estimation of structural disconnection offers an elegant and
  economical alternative. For this approach, a patient's structural lesion
  information and normative connectome data are combined to estimate different
  measures of lesion-induced structural disconnection. Using one of several
  toolboxes, this method is relatively easy to implement and is even available
  to scientists without expertise in fibre tracking analyses. Nevertheless, the
  anatomo-behavioural statistical mapping of structural brain disconnection
  requires analysis steps that are not covered by these toolboxes. In this
  paper, we first review the current state of indirect lesion disconnection
  estimation, the different existing measures, and the available software.
  Second, we aim to fill the remaining methodological gap in statistical
  disconnection-symptom mapping by providing an overview and guide to
  disconnection data and the statistical mapping of their relationship to
  behavioural measurements using either univariate or multivariate statistical
  modelling. To assist in the practical implementation of statistical analyses,
  we have included software tutorials and analysis scripts.%

    Modelling behavioural deficits based on structural lesion imaging is a
  popular approach to map functions in the human brain, and efforts to
  translationally apply lesion-behaviour modelling to predict post-stroke
  outcomes are on the rise. The high-dimensional complexity of lesion data,
  however, evokes challenges in both lesion behaviour mapping and post stroke
  outcome prediction. This paper aims to deepen the understanding of this
  complexity by reframing it from the perspective of causal and non-causal
  dependencies in the data, and by discussing what this complexity implies for
  different data modelling approaches. By means of theoretical discussion and
  empirical examination, several common strategies and views are challenged,
  and future research perspectives are outlined. A main conclusion is that
  lesion-behaviour inference is subject to a lesion-anatomical bias that cannot
  be overcome by using multivariate models or any other algorithm that is blind
  to causality behind relations in the data. This affects the validity of
  lesion behaviour mapping and might even wrongfully identify paradoxical
  effects of lesion-induced functional facilitation - but, as this paper
  argues, only to a minor degree. Thus, multivariate lesion-brain inference
  appears to be a valuable tool to deepen our understanding of the human brain,
  but only because it takes into account the functional relation between brain
  areas. The perspective of causality and inter-variable dependence is further
  used to point out challenges in improving lesion behaviour models. Firstly,
  the dependencies in the data open up different possible strategies of data
  reduction, and considering those might improve post-stroke outcome
  prediction. Secondly, the role of non-topographical causal predictors of post
  stroke behaviour is discussed. The present article argues that, given these
  predictors, different strategies are required in the evaluation of model
  quality in lesion behaviour mapping and post stroke outcome prediction.%

  Levy, R., Dubois, B., 2007. A novel approach to clinical-radiological
  correlations: Anatomo-Clinical Overlapping Maps (AnaCOM): method and
  validation. NeuroImage 37: 1237-1249.) have recently described a novel
  approach for lesion-behavior mapping (LBM), referred to as Anatomo-Clinical
  Overlapping Maps (AnaCOM). Conventional voxelwise LBM tools apply statistics
  to contrast behavioral performance of patients with lesions that encompass
  given voxels to control patients where these voxels are spared. In contrast,
  AnaCOM contrasts performance of patients with injury involving given voxels
  to the performance of neurologically healthy participants. The authors
  correctly note that their procedure can offer substantially more statistical
  power than conventional LBM methods. We compared AnaCOM to conventional LBM
  techniques by examining hemiparesis (a common consequence of stroke) as the
  behavior of interest. We found that AnaCOM detected many regions of the
  middle cerebral artery territory not associated with the motor system. We
  suggest that conventional LBM techniques detect regions that are damaged in
  patients with a deficit while spared in those without a deficit, while AnaCOM
  detects regions that are associated with a deficit. Therefore, this new
  measure may offer poor specificity. Furthermore, on theoretical grounds we
  suggest that permutation-based thresholding will be a more sensitive method
  for controlling familywise error than the method of counting lesion-overlap
  clusters used by AnaCOM. Finally, we note that the within group variability
  tends to be smaller for neurologically healthy controls than in neurological
  patients, due to ceiling effects. Therefore, we suggest that nonparametric
  measures or the Welch's t-test are more appropriate than the conventional
  pooled variance t-test used by AnaCOM.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    High-dimensional modelling of post-stroke deficits from structural brain
  imaging is highly relevant to basic cognitive neuroscience and bears the
  potential to be translationally used to guide individual rehabilitation
  measures. One strategy to optimise model performance is well-informed feature
  selection and representation. However, different feature representation
  strategies were so far used, and it is not known what strategy is best for
  modelling purposes. The present study compared the three common main
  strategies: voxel-wise representation, lesion-anatomical componential feature
  reduction and region-wise atlas-based feature representation. We used
  multivariate, machine-learning-based lesion-deficit models to predict
  post-stroke deficits based on structural lesion data. Support vector
  regression was tuned by nested cross-validation techniques and tested on
  held-out validation data to estimate model performance. While we consistently
  found the numerically best models for lower-dimensional, featurised data and
  almost always for principal components extracted from lesion maps, our
  results indicate only minor, non-significant differences between different
  feature representation styles. Hence, our findings demonstrate the general
  suitability of all three commonly applied feature representations in
  lesion-deficit modelling. Likewise, model performance between qualitatively
  different popular brain atlases was not significantly different. Our findings
  also highlight potential minor benefits in individual fine-tuning of feature
  representations and the challenge posed by the high, multifaceted complexity
  of lesion data, where lesion-anatomical and functional criteria might suggest
  opposing solutions to feature reduction.%

    Measurement of recovery after stroke is becoming increasingly important
  with the advent of new treatment options under investigation in stroke
  rehabilitation research. The Fugl-Meyer scale was developed as the first
  quantitative evaluative instrument for measuring sensorimotor stroke
  recovery, based on Twitchell and Brunnstrom's concept of sequential stages of
  motor return in the hemiplegic stroke patient. The Fugl-Meyer is a
  well-designed, feasible and efficient clinical examination method that has
  been tested widely in the stroke population. Its primary value is the
  100-point motor domain, which has received the most extensive evaluation.
  Excellent interrater and intrarater reliability and construct validity have
  been demonstrated, and preliminary evidence suggests that the Fugl-Meyer
  assessment is responsive to change. Limitations of the motor domain include a
  ceiling effect, omission of some potentially relevant items, and weighting of
  the arm more than the leg. Further study should test performance of this
  scale in specific subgroups of stroke patients and better define its
  criterion validity, sensitivity to change, and minimal clinically important
  difference. Based on the available evidence, the Fugl-Meyer motor scale is
  recommended highly as a clinical and research tool for evaluating changes in
  motor impairment following stroke.%

    The study of stroke and its treatment in human subjects requires accurate
  measurement of behavioral status. Arm motor deficits are among the most
  common sequelae after stroke. The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is a
  reliable, valid measure of arm motor status after stroke. This test has
  established value for characterizing clinical state and for measuring
  spontaneous and therapy-induced recovery; however, sufficient details have
  not been previously published to allow for performance of this scale in a
  standardized manner over time and across sites. Such an approach to ARAT
  scoring would likely reduce variance between investigators and sites. This
  report therefore includes a manual that provides a highly detailed and
  standardized approach for assigning ARAT scores. Intrarater reliability and
  interrater reliability, as well as validity, with this approach were measured
  and are excellent. The ARAT, when performed in a standardized manner, is a
  useful tool for assessment of arm motor deficits after stroke.%

    BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Barthel Index (BI) and the Modified Rankin
  Scale (MRS) are commonly used scales that measure disability or dependence in
  activities of daily living in stroke victims. The objective of this study was
  to investigate how these scales were used and interpreted in acute stroke
  trials. METHODS: We identified from MEDLINE the major efficacy trials with
  neuroprotective drugs, thrombolytic drugs, and anticoagulants in acute
  ischemic stroke published between January 1995 and December 1998. We selected
  those trials that used the BI and/or MRS as outcome parameters. RESULTS:
  Fifteen trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria were identified. The BI was
  used in 13 and the MRS in 8. In 4 trials mean and median scores of the BI
  were used, and in 1 trial median scores of the MRS were compared. Primary end
  points included the BI in 7, the MRS in 6, and both the BI and MRS in 3. With
  regard to the BI, a variety of sum scores between 50 and 95 were used as
  cutoff scores to define favorable outcome. Favorable outcome on the MRS was
  defined as either 3, or BI <60.%

    Stroke remains a leading cause of adult disability, and the recovery of
  motor function after stroke is crucial for the patient to regain
  independence. However, making accurate predictions of a patient's motor
  recovery and outcome is difficult when based on clinical assessment alone.
  Clinical assessment of motor impairment within a few days of stroke can help
  to predict subsequent recovery, while neurophysiological and neuroimaging
  biomarkers of corticomotor structure and function can help to predict both
  motor recovery and motor outcome after stroke. The combination of biomarkers
  can provide clinically useful information when planning the personalised
  rehabilitation of a patient. These biomarkers can also be used for patient
  selection and stratification in trials investigating rehabilitation
  interventions that are initiated early after stroke. Ongoing multicentre
  trials that incorporate motor biomarkers could help to bring their use into
  routine clinical practice.%

    The purpose of this study was to develop a high-resolution sensorimotor
  area tract template (SMATT) which segments corticofugal tracts based on 6
  cortical regions in primary motor cortex, dorsal premotor cortex, ventral
  premotor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), pre-supplementary motor area
  (preSMA), and primary somatosensory cortex using diffusion tensor imaging.
  Individual probabilistic tractography analyses were conducted in 100 subjects
  using the highest resolution data currently available. Tractography results
  were refined using a novel algorithm to objectively determine slice level
  thresholds that best minimized overlap between tracts while preserving tract
  volume. Consistent with tracing studies in monkey and rodent, our
  observations show that cortical topography is generally preserved through the
  internal capsule, with the preSMA tract remaining most anterior and the
  primary somatosensory tract remaining most posterior. We combine our results
  into a freely available white matter template named the SMATT. We also
  provide a probabilistic SMATT that quantifies the extent of overlap between
  tracts. Finally, we assess how the SMATT operates at the individual subject
  level in another independent data set, and in an individual after stroke. The
  SMATT and probabilistic SMATT provide new tools that segment and label
  sensorimotor tracts at a spatial resolution not previously available.%

    Lesion to symptom mapping (LSM) is a crucial tool for understanding the
  causality of brain-behavior relationships. The analyses are typically
  performed by applying statistical methods on individual brain voxels (VLSM),
  a method called the mass-univariate approach. Several authors have shown that
  VLSM suffers from limitations that may decrease the accuracy and reliability
  of the findings, and have proposed the use of multivariate methods to
  overcome these limitations. In this study, we propose a multivariate
  optimization technique known as sparse canonical correlation analysis for
  neuroimaging (SCCAN) for lesion to symptom mapping. To validate the method
  and compare it with mass-univariate results, we used data from 131 patients
  with chronic stroke lesions in the territory of the middle cerebral artery,
  and created synthetic behavioral scores based on the lesion load of 93 brain
  regions (putative functional units). LSM analyses were performed with
  univariate VLSM or SCCAN, and the accuracy of the two methods was compared in
  terms of both overlap and displacement from the simulated functional areas.
  Overall, SCCAN produced more accurate results - higher dice overlap and
  smaller average displacement - compared to VLSM. This advantage persisted at
  different sample sizes (N = 20-131) and different multiple comparison
  corrections (false discovery rate, FDR; Bonferroni; permutation-based family
  wise error rate, FWER). These findings were replicated with a fully automated
  SCCAN routine that relied on cross-validated predictive accuracy to find the
  optimal sparseness value. Simulations of one, two, and three brain regions
  showed a systematic advantage of SCCAN over VLSM; under no circumstance could
  VLSM exceed the accuracy obtained with SCCAN. When considering functional
  units composed of multiple brain areas VLSM identified fewer areas than
  SCCAN. The investigation of real scores of aphasia severity (aphasia quotient
  and picture naming) showed that SCCAN could accurately identify known
  language-critical areas, while VLSM either produced diffuse maps (FDR
  correction) or few scattered voxels (FWER correction). Overall, this study
  shows that a multivariate method, such as, SCCAN, outperforms VLSM in a
  number of scenarios, including functional dependency on single or multiple
  areas, different sample sizes, different multi-area combinations, and
  different thresholding mechanisms (FWER, Bonferroni, FDR). These results
  support previous claims that multivariate methods are in general more
  accurate than mass-univariate approaches, and should be preferred over
  traditional VLSM approaches. All the methods described in this study are
  available in the newly developed LESYMAP package for R.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Diffusion MRI streamlines tractography allows for the investigation of the
  brain white matter pathways non-invasively. However a fundamental limitation
  of this technology is its non-quantitative nature, i.e. the density of
  reconstructed connections is not reflective of the density of underlying
  white matter fibres. As a solution to this problem, we have previously
  published the ``spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms
  (SIFT)'' method, which determines a subset of the streamlines reconstruction
  such that the streamlines densities throughout the white matter are as close
  as possible to fibre densities estimated using the spherical deconvolution
  diffusion model; this permits the use of streamline count as a valid
  biological marker of connection density. Particular aspects of its
  performance may have however limited its uptake in the diffusion MRI research
  community. Here we present an alternative to this method, entitled SIFT2,
  which provides a more logically direct and computationally efficient solution
  to the streamlines connectivity quantification problem: by determining an
  appropriate cross-sectional area multiplier for each streamline rather than
  removing streamlines altogether, biologically accurate measures of fibre
  connectivity are obtained whilst making use of the complete streamlines
  reconstruction.%

    We present a technique for automatically assigning a neuroanatomical label
  to each voxel in an MRI volume based on probabilistic information
  automatically estimated from a manually labeled training set. In contrast to
  existing segmentation procedures that only label a small number of tissue
  classes, the current method assigns one of 37 labels to each voxel, including
  left and right caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, lateral ventricles,
  hippocampus, and amygdala. The classification technique employs a
  registration procedure that is robust to anatomical variability, including
  the ventricular enlargement typically associated with neurological diseases
  and aging. The technique is shown to be comparable in accuracy to manual
  labeling, and of sufficient sensitivity to robustly detect changes in the
  volume of noncortical structures that presage the onset of probable
  Alzheimer's disease.%

    Machine learning has shown utility in detecting patterns within large,
  unstructured, and complex datasets. One of the promising applications of
  machine learning is in precision medicine, where disease risk is predicted
  using patient genetic data. However, creating an accurate prediction model
  based on genotype data remains challenging due to the so-called ``curse of
  dimensionality'' (i.e., extensively larger number of features compared to the
  number of samples). Therefore, the generalizability of machine learning
  models benefits from feature selection, which aims to extract only the most
  ``informative'' features and remove noisy ``non-informative,'' irrelevant and
  redundant features. In this article, we provide a general overview of the
  different feature selection methods, their advantages, disadvantages, and use
  cases, focusing on the detection of relevant features (i.e., SNPs) for
  disease risk prediction.%
